                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” And Hunt frequently used the abbreviation “Do.” for ditto; this has not been changed. The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

The Clk. Is directed to furnish him with a copy of this minute and sign it on behalf of the meeting.”</note> I left home to visit some meetings in Bucks and Abington quarters [in] Pennsylvania. Got to Mount Holly Meeting on Fifth Day which was very poor, low, little to be done. Here I met Hinchman Hains of Gabriel Daviss. Sixth Day had an appointed meeting for H.H. [<persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName>] at Crosswicks. He took up almost the whole time and was much favoured. In the evening had a meeting at Bordentown. The few Friends there the house was crowded full and the weight fell on me and I believe it ended to general satisfaction. A Methodist minister was there and came to our lodging and said he wanted some friendly religious discourse with us and we parted friendly and respectfully he expressing great love and friendship for us.  7th Day had a meeting at Trenton. Religion seemed to be at a low ebb and hard getting along though. I hope we came off without loss. This evening I got to my friend Jonathan Kirkbride's.  My companions went on pursuant to their prospect down the river.</p></div>
