                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” And Hunt frequently used the abbreviation “Do.” for ditto; this has not been changed. The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

The indulgence of harsh dispositions is the introduction of future misery.  Remember Trout[?] Haman all availed him nothing w[cut off]: Disturb in mind and hoss[?] t[cut off] Ended.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1806-08-24"><dateline><date when="1806-08-24">24th 8th Month 1806.</date></dateline><p> Although we have had a very fruitful season here in our parts vast plenty of apples, pears, cherries, fruit of every kind, watermelons, cucumbers so plenty and cheap in market that they would not pay the expense of taking there and abundance thrown away a very mortifying time to the truck mongers or truck merchants the like was never known in such vast plenty I don't doubt but many wagon loads of watermelons and cucumbers will be thrown away. They are in such vast plenty in our Jersey land and a very good harvest for rye and wheat and the greatest prospect of a vast great crop of Indian corn and buckwheat that ever was known yet I am told by eye witnesses that a little below Salem they have had a pinching time of drought so that a few weeks ago they could rub the corn leaves to snuff,  and  a Friend who lately traveled through New England Isaac C. Jones told me a great drought prevailed through that part of the country eastward especially in province of Maine so called. The drought is mentioned in the newspapers very piercing indeed in the time of this dry weather the fire broke out the wind being very high and raged to a great degree spread over and consumed a great part of the country burnt up and destroyed, many settlements so that many great farmers who had lived in affluence and plenty were now by that means reduced to poverty and want being burnt out of house and home.</p>
<p>See William Edmundson's <emph rend="italic">Journal </emph>an account of a time of great scarcity which was soon succeeded [by] a time of great plenty which was made known to him and he had to prophecy foretell and forewarn the people and told the people the Lord would lash them with his judgment and dung [?] the ground with the carcasses of men which shortly after soon came to pass,  and many died for want of bread and tuffs of rank green grass were seen on the common where carcasses of people had dunged the ground and s[missing] his prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
<p>[Marginal note, written sideways] 1807 John Haines traveling in new England this summer says they have had no harvest over a great part of that country the winter and Insects destroyed their wheat that they made bread without bottling their meal,  bran and all together and would allow but ten pound of hay a night for a horse.</p></div>

<quote>One act of triumph over the temper is worth a million of triumphs over our fellow creatures and the perfect dominion of our mind is more advantageous and laudable than the dominion over provinces and nations the one attaches merely our corporal part and is buried with us in the dust in the grave the other follows our immortal part and passes with it into eternity.</quote>


<p>As said the poet:<quote type="poem">
<l>He is more a prince that rules himself</l>
<l>Than he whom nations keeps in awe,</l>
<l>Who yields to that which doth their souls convince</l>
<l>Shall never need another law</l>
<l>He that ruleth his spirit is stronger than he</l>
<l>That taketh a city: he that ruleth not his</l>
<l>Spirit is like to a city whose walls are broken</l>
<l>Down and without strength</l></quote>: says Solomon</p></div>
