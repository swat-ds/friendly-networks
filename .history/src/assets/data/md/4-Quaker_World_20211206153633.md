# The Quaker World of John Hunt

John Hunt regularly attended meetings for worship at Chester meeting house in Moorestown in Burlington County, New Jersey; he and his family were members of Chester Preparative Meeting.

At the time when he began to keep a journal in 1770, Hunt participated in seven or eight Quaker meetings each month; after 1783, when he was recommended as a minister, he was in meeting at least every three days.[^19] At the time that Chester Monthly Meeting was set off from Evesham in 1803, for instance, the monthly business meeting was scheduled for the third day of the week following the second second-day in each month, and the Select Meeting of Ministers and Elders on the sixth day of the week preceding the first second day (on a quarterly basis); mid week meeting (for worship) at Chester was on fifth day, and the preparative meeting the week preceding their monthly meeting. In addition to an annual Yearly Meeting held in Philadelphia over the course of several days, there were also Youth’s Meetings, Negro Meetings, General Meetings, and Called Meetings when Friends and others were invited to hear Friends who were traveling in the ministry.

[^19]: It is common to distinguish between Meetings for Worship and Meetings for Business, but John Hunt likely considered all meetings to be meetings for worship.  See ["Structure of Quaker meetings"](/background/quaker-bg/structure-society-friends) for a more detailed explanation of the structure of the Society of Friends in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

In 1772 Hunt first felt moved to offer testimony in meeting for worship but was initially conflicted:
>This was the day I first gave up to say a few words in a public First Day meeting. In great diffidence, dread and fear a strong persuasion attended my mind that if I did give up to speak all and even my wife would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for my wife spoke comfortably and encouragingly and indeed I believe I needed it, for I was almost ready to sink so that some said they pitied me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased come on me what will or may.[^20]

John Hunt was acknowledged as a minister in 1783 by Evesham Monthly Meeting. Quaker ministers were lay men and women who were recognized as being unusually inspired by the Spirit of God and provided most of the vocal messages in meeting for worship. They were not ordained but were formally designated or “recorded” by the monthly meeting. Regular meetings of ministers and elders, called “preparative meetings of ministers and elders,” or “select meetings,” were held to consider the spiritual life of the meeting. These gatherings were called “select” as only ministers and elders could participate. Unlike the meetings for business, men and women acted together in the select meetings.

Ministers who discerned that it was their duty to travel outside of their own neighborhood in “Truth’s service” obtained a certificate, basically a letter of introduction, signed by members of the monthly meeting attesting to their suitability. These travelling ministers were the glue that held the Quaker world together. They visited families and meetings in America and abroad as they felt “led by the spirit.”

Ministers were expected to be good examples to other Friends and to the “world:” in 1803, for example, Chester Monthly Meeting recorded:
>Our esteemed friend John Hunt opened to this meeting a concern to pay a religious visit to some meetings of friends (and others as way may open) within the compass of Salem and Burlington Quarters: which being weightily considered was united with and he left at liberty to proceed therein as Truth may open his way, being an approved minister amongst us. The Clerk is directed to furnish him with a copy of this minute and sign it on behalf of this meeting.[^21]

Earlier, in the fall of 1792, John Hunt Hunt “opened… a prospect that had for some time attended his mind, to pay a religious mind, to pay a religious visit to his friends and relatives in parts of Maryland, Virginia and Red Stone settlement”[^22] to Evesham Monthly meeting which approved his request. On October 5, 1792, he and his companion, [Samuel Roberts, Sr.](/entities/w6xt6kzb/), left on October 5th and returned on November 24, 1792. Hunt wrote: “Had a pleasant prosperous journey to good satisfaction. Had many precious favored times both in meetings and Friends’ families and got home 24 of the Eleventh Month, 1792, and found all well, which I esteemed a great favor.”[^23] Hunt kept the narrative of their journal on another paper; unfortunately, this account has not been located.
