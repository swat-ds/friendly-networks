Following William Penn’s advice, John Hunt kept a journal for over half a century, beginning in 1770 and ending shortly before his death in 1824. This original work, penned in his own hand, is in the collections of Friends Historical Library (hereafter FHL). It survives in eleven separate volumes plus a number of loose sheets. It is lacking the section -- apart from the several loose sheets -- dating between the end of 1800 and the 7th month of 1812. 

Part of the original document was given to Friends Historical Library in 1956. This portion consisted of an incomplete manuscript, 1812-1824, including two loose sheets from 1806 and 1808, and 11 parts from 7mo7 1812 to 10mo10 1824. These were said to have been in the possession of Dr. Rachel Williams of Moorestown, New Jersey, and had been given by her to William Bacon Evans for him to convey to this Library. Rachel was the daughter of Jonathan G. and Susanna R. Williams, and Susanna was the Daughter of David and Rachel Hunt Roberts. The latter was a child of Joshua Hunt, John Hunt's half-brother.

The earlier section of the original journal was traced to members of the Stackhouse family who had inherited it from Asa M. Stackhouse. The latter had given permission for an excerpted publication to the New Jersey Historical Society in the 1930s. It was donated it to FHL in 2004. The part of Hunt’s journal from 1776 to 1787 was originally bound with accounts dating from 1769-1772; both of these were paginated, pages numbered 73-172 and 51-72 respectively. It is unknown what, if anything, preceded page 51.

No manuscript text has yet been discovered covering the period from 1800 to 7mo 1812. A much abbreviated text for this period is included in _Friends Miscellany_ in 1837.[^4] John Comly and the other editors of _Friends Miscellany_ had access to the entire manuscript, including the now missing section, as well as to other writings by Hunt. They took great liberties in editing and shortening the text. For instance, the published section from 1770-1800 is less than 10% of the original for the same period.

A second variant was published in the Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society in 1934.[^5] It was abridged from the partial original then in the possession of T. Matlack Stackhouse, presumed to be the same as the first part (1770-1800) of the journal now in the collections of FHL.

[^5]: _Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society,_ vol. 52, 1934: pp. 177-193, 223-239; & vol.  53, 1935: pp. 27-43, 111-128, 194-2209, 251-262.  Edison, N.J.  The New Jersey Historical Society also purchased a full typescript in 1986, available in that library as part of Manuscript Group 1245.
