# Evans's Journal

Joshua Evans's journal fits well into the broader genre of Quaker spiritual autobiographies. It focuses on his observations on Quakerly matters in his travels, rather than personal details. Thus, while the autobiographical section mentions his first marriage (to Priscilla Collins) as a major impetus for reforming his ways, no further mention is made of the marriage or of Priscilla, nor does Evans actually mention his second wife by name. Reading his diaries reveals someone who often suffered from extended periods of despondency, and whether this was indicative of the burdens of his spiritual piety and personal asceticism or of a generally melancholic disposition is unclear.

## Publication History

 Although today Evans is lesser known than his contemporary John Woolman, his rich and interesting life caught the attention of George Churchman in the early nineteenth century. In 1804, Churchman significantly revised and abridged Evans’s original journals, and in 1837, this version was published as “An Abstracted Journal of the Life, Early Baptisms, and Religious Exercises of Joshua Evans” in _Friends’ Miscellany, Volume 10._ In the preface, Churchman wrote that he captured the “narrative of the substance (not without a little alteration of the style in some parts).” To date, this reworked version of Evans’s journals remains the only published source of Evans’s writings. 

In 1934, Thomas Fawcett began tracking down the original and transcribed journals of Evans's life. He noted that Churchman’s alterations to the original journals did not consistently “improve \[Evans’s] style, and they certainly take away from its quaintness and character of individuality.” 

## Manuscript Witnesses
Eight manuscript copies of Evans’s journals survive, six of which are held by the Friends Historical Library. Two are original manuscripts penned by Joshua Evans; these record his two northern journeys (Ms B) and two southern journeys (MS C). Two are transcripts by Evans’s son-in-law Abraham Warrington; these comprise an autobiography of his early life (MS A) and an account of his travels in the Northeast (MS D) based on MS B. 

The remaining four manuscripts are examples of an edition of the journals produced by George Churchman in 1804, which seems to have circulated in manuscript form before being published in John Comly’s _Friends’ Miscellany_. MSS H, E, and F represent one copy of this edition in three consecutive volumes. MS G, held at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, represents all three volumes, owned by William Stump in 1812 and rebound by his relative William Stump Forwood into a single volume in 1869. The page numbering between MSS H, E, & F and MS G is surprisingly consistent, suggesting that they shared an exemplar or are otherwise closely related.

## Editing Principles
This edition aims both to retain Evans’s writing style and to prove accessible to the modern reader. It features three different journals: the autobiography transcribed by Evans’s son-in-law Abraham Warrington ([MS A](/journals/A0011540)) and the two journals in Evans’s own hand ([MS B](/journals/A0011541) and [MS C](/journals/A0011543)). These journals are held by the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. For the last four years of journal entries, up to three variants from other manuscripts may exist for any particular entry. By using Evans’s original writings when possible and falling back on Warrington’s faithful transcription to cover the gaps, this edition aims to come as close as possible to presenting a full account of Evans’s life in his own words.

The journals feature nonstandard spellings, random capitalizations, tense shifting, and a distinct lack of punctuation marks, all of which have been modified to modern conventions in this edition. Long, uninterrupted sections of text have been divided for clarity. Occasional words have been inserted or replaced, as indicated in brackets, with a consideration of the author’s style and intent. However, known antiquated spellings have been preserved, as have the capitalizations of “God,” “Lord,” “Truth,” and “Friend.” For Evans, the terms “close” and “clost” appear to have different meanings; thus, the non-word “clost” remains unchanged. Clauses within a sentence have been rearranged only when their meaning is otherwise obscured. Place names and Quaker meetings have also been capitalized. For ease of reading, the format of the date has been standardized.
