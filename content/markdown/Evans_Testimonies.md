# Evans's Testimonies

Joshua Evans was deeply motivated by Quaker testimonies, especially those of plainness, peace, and antislavery.

## Plainness
The plainness testimony was central to much of Evans's life and conduct, which at times verged on asceticism. In the annual queries, Friends were advised to be “careful to bring up those under their direction in plainness of speech and apparel…” Ministers and elders were particularly advised to bring up their families in “plainness in dress, language, and true moderation.”[^1] This call to avoid superfluity and excess is evident throughout Evans's journals. 

[^1]: _The Old Discipline: Nineteenth-Century Friends Disciplines in America._  Glenside, Pennsylvania: Quaker Heritage Press, 1999, 99-101.

Evans's pursuit of "true moderation" impelled him to go beyond Friends' conventional practices. Most Quakers in the 18th century were easily recognized by their plain dress and plain speech, which consisted, respectively, of gray unornamented clothing and the habit of addressing individuals with the archaic singular pronoun "thou." Evans, however, was uneasy stopping at these customary practices, and took to wearing undyed clothing and a full beard. As he wrote in his autobiography, he saw the dying process as wasteful, and argued that the effort would be better spent keeping clothes clean:
> The Lord was pleased to give me to see the vanity of and loss of time in dying our garments many colors, some of which is very injurious to the cloth, but the heart and mind so set thereon the pattern must be followed be the damage what it may. And by this means good pieces of cloth are much damaged, and this excess pleaded for only to hide dirt, which seems to me no part of cleanliness. For hiding faults is not a cleansing from sin, so hiding dirt doth not remove the filth thereof, for I should suppose the same quantity of dirt would gather on the dyed as the undyed garment with the same wear. Then surely, if the expense and injury of dying was laid out in washing, we should be more cleanly. 

However, despite his convictions, Evans at first felt great trepidation about "the reproach" others would give him for such singular garments. Three times he crossed from New Jersey to Philadelphia to buy a white hat but lost his nerve at the last moment:
> The cross in wearing white clothes was more than I could bear. I pleaded my insufficiency for such a singular work, fearing I should not bear the reproach thereof, but my pained soul could not get ease until I submitted to . . . wear white clothes. . . . To get a white hat and stockings was as far as I could see at that time, and after wearing my old one till it was not fit to be seen, I went to Philadelphia with intent to get a white hat, but returned home without. . . . I made another trial, and then through weakness got a black one. This brought such trouble on me, I verily thought I felt the terrors of Hell by night and by day, until I became willing to be a reproach among men—and to confess my fault to the man I got the black one of, and offer to pay for the damage done if he would take the hat again and inform me where I could get a white one, which he did. My mind was much bowed but not low enough, for I returned home without buying one.

Only on his fourth attempt did Evans follow through completely.
