# Joshua Evans: An Overview

Joshua Evans (1731-1798) was born in Evesham, New Jersey. After a self-described rebellious youth, he experienced a religious awakening around the year 1753. Evans became an acknowledged minister and spent his final years traveling on religious journeys across North America, eventually visiting nearly every monthly meeting then on the continent.

Evans’s spirituality manifested itself in a number of behaviours and beliefs that distinguished him among Friends and led many to consider him quite eccentric. Unfashionably for the time, Evans wore a beard, on the grounds that shaving was a vain custom. He also abstained from wearing dyed clothing due to the waste that was part of the dying process.[^1] His all-white clothing and bearded face were among the reasons Evans credited for the large crowds who appeared at meetings he attended in his travels.

However, these idiosyncracies almost prevented Evans from embarking on his travels in the first place due to the controversey they stirred among other Quakers. Because “singularity” — acting in a manner that was more extreme — could be a source of undue pride, Evans's decision to grow a beard resulted in the appointment of a Select committee, on which Evans's friend John Hunt served. Though Hunt supported Evans's testimony, not everyone did; Hunt recorded that “many of his Friends became uneasy, apprehending he was running beyond the motions of truth into unprofitable imaginations. They highly esteemed him before, and now extended to him their earnest admonitions.”[^2] The committee visit was conducted with "good temper," and Hunt described it as a "good edifying time," though very different sentiments appeared. In the end, Evans "was left with his beard on much as we found him."[^3] Nevertheless, the "singularity" of Evans's beard made the meeting hesitate to grant him a travel certificate for a number of years.[^4]

Evans's peculiarities were not limited to his appearance. He avoided tea, coffee, sugar and molasses, and meat, and used only leather made from animals that had died naturally. Evans was also a particularly strong proponent of the peace testimony, notable for his opposition to the use of imported goods for the duties laid on them by the early American government to defray the costs of war against Native Americans. In addition, like many Quakers, he was fiercely opposed to the institution of slavery. 

Evans began his travels in 1794 and undertook several long trips in the ministry until his death in July, 1798. His journals reflect someone deeply concerned with Friendly testimonies regarding simplicity and plainness and worried that Friends in many places were falling too much into worldly behaviors. Evans often preached about the poor treatment faced by Native Americans, and was especially vehement in his condemnations of slavery in his travels in the South. He was a contemporary and relative of New Jersey Quakers [John Woolman](/people/w6wr0v4m) (1720-1772) and [John Hunt](/background/hunt-bg) (1740-1824). His ideas on Quaker piety were similar to some espoused in the writings of another contemporary, Long Island Quaker [Elias Hicks](/people/w6rj4s40) (1748-1830).
