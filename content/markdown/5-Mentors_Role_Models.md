# “Dear Friends:” Mentors and Role Models

It is clear that Hunt respected and admired fellow ministers and other people that he dealt with in his daily life. The quality of their testimony was a common theme in his journal. [Richard Jordan (1756-1826)](/entities/w6gq882n/), for instance, began to speak in the ministry after 1781 and travelled widely. He was an active anti-slavery advocate and also gave up the habit of smoking tobacco. John Hunt first met Jordan as he was travelling in 1800 with his kinsman, [Nathan Hunt](/entities/w6wh3qkh). John Hunt spoke of Jordan’s testimony as “very lively and delivered with great force and strength.”[^1] And at the Select Meeting at Evesham, noted “Richard exceeded all, it was most excellent.”[^2]

However, there were a few individuals who merited descriptives of “dear” or “near.” Of these [Joshua Evans](/entities/w6c82qz0/), [Joshua Lippincott](/entities/w6jb6xn6/), and [John Parrish](/entities/w63g5dz0/) were among those singled out. It is clear that John Hunt greatly esteemed fellow minister [Joshua Evans (1731-1798)](/entities/w6c82qz0/) of Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. Evans was a frequent companion and close friend. After Evans’s burial Hunt added a note to an earlier entry, “This, our dear Friend, died very suddenly. . . . Between us there has been adistinguished unity ever since I embarked in the cause of truth. For then, he as it were took me by the hand, and steadied me as a father, and so he has been to me ever since."[^3]

 <figcaption><i>“A Monday Morning View of Friends Meeting House and Academy, Philadelphia, Forty Years Ago.” This lithograph was originally drawn by W.L. Breton and produced by Kennedy & Lucas in 1829; a later card photograph of the print was taken and sold by Isaac G. Tyson after the Civil War. On the back of the latter, four individuals were identified: Benjamin Chew, John or Henry Drinker, Robert Proud, and William Waring. The individual shown second from the right is probably Joshua Evans as his undyed attire was characteristic; it is interesting that the artist chose to picture him coming face-to-face with Chew, an enslaver and birthright Friend who had been previously disowned and is dressed in a more fashionable jacket. All would have been present in or around the meeting house on 4th Street, south of Chestnut, in 1789. Courtesy Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College.</i></figcaption>

Evans avoided tea, coffee, sugar and molasses, and meat, and used only leather made from animals that had died naturally. Like [John Woolman](/entities/w6wr0v4m), he wore undyed clothing, dye being made by slave labor. This behavior caused some concern among Friends because “singularity” — acting in a manner that was more extreme — could be a source of undue pride. When Evans began to cultivate a long beard, his cumulative behaviors resulted in the appointment of a Select committee. Apparently Hunt supported Evans’ testimony. He wrote: “many of his Friends became uneasy; apprehending he was running beyond the motions of truth into unprofitable imaginations. They highly esteemed him before, and now extended to him their earnest admonitions.”[^4] The committee visit was conducted with "good temper," and Hunt described it as a "good edifying time," though very different sentiments appeared. In the end, Evans "was left with his beard on much as we found him."[^5]

When Evans died in 1813 at the age of 80, Hunt wrote: “Between me and him there has been an uninterrupted unity between thirty and forty years. He was an elder of good and sound judgment although of but few words; he was like a father to me, and we were always suited together with one another’s company.” [^6]

[John Parrish (1729-1807)](/entities/w63g5dz0/), another well beloved friend, was a Quaker abolitionist and a proponent of Native American rights. Parrish is best remembered for authoring _Remarks on the Slavery of the Black People._ Published in 1806, Parrish's pamphlet covered such issues as Biblical anti-slavery, constitutional rationales for emancipation, colonization, and African-American political protest. At Parrish’s death Hunt remarked that their acquaintance had begun before 1772 and that he usually stayed with him in Philadelphia during Yearly Meeting, “very pleasant and edifying was his company and converse.”[^7]
