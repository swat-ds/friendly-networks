# Introducing John Hunt



John Hunt was a Quaker minister from Burlington County, New Jersey. He was born in 1740 and died in 1824. At the age of thirty Hunt began keeping a daily journal and continued it until his death, a remarkable fifty-four years recording his everyday activities and intimate thoughts. While this journal is not a literary masterpiece, it does present extraordinary insights into his life and times.

There is very little information about the first years of Hunt’s life. He was a birthright member of Evesham Monthly Meeting, the son of Robert Hunt and his first wife Abigail. The later printed version of Hunt’s journal contains a brief autobiographical fragment which is not included in the manuscript original:
> At divers times in my very youthful days, and particularly when about eight years of age, I was favored with the tendering visitations of Divine goodness; the effects of which were marked in my countenance and deportment, so as to attract the notice of my friends. And afterward as I grew up, and before I was of age, I used sometimes to seek places of retirement, and spend the afternoons of first-days in reading the scriptures and other religious books; refusing to go into company—and in so doing I felt the reward of peace. But not abiding in this tender watchful state, I gave way again and again, to go into unprofitable company; and sometimes spent the first-days in a way which brought trouble, and cost me many tears in solitary corners.[^1]

Begun in 1770, Hunt’s journal recorded his day to day work life, family events, his own spiritual state of mind and that of the meetings he attended, and local and national events.

The bulk of the early entries revolve around farming his own property and working as a rural joiner. Interestingly, the journal also functioned as an account book, listing his customers and whether their accounts were current. Hunt turned wooden pumps of various sizes but also supplied plows, cradles, coffins, and benches, the usual products of a local craftsman. On the farm and in his shop he was sometimes aided by his sons, apprentices, indentured servants, and hired help. Patterns of work were dictated by the seasons. During September of 1770, for instance, he recorded days spent putting up an apple mill, trimming casks, making furniture, going to the mill, husking and hauling corn, splicing pumps, getting firewood, picking winter apples, and other regular chores.

While the first years are largely an accounting of his working life, Hunt becomes increasingly interested in documenting his spiritual progress as well, a sort of confession of faith. He records his participation in what seems like an endless series of Quaker meetings for worship and for business. After he was recognized as a minister in 1783, his activities on behalf of the Religious Society of Friends expanded and the journal reveals much of the customs and practices of the Quakers in the Delaware Valley in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Hunt’s journal is not myopically focused on personal or even Quaker concerns; Hunt also records information about his wider world. In 1798, for instance, he noted, “We hear that the yellow fever is very mortal in Philadelphia and that the greater part of the inhabitants is fled and that it is in Burlington and likewise in New York they are moving out and that it is at Morris’s River very mortal – twelve died in eleven days. And we hear that divers have died on the highways, in the wood, barns and at Moorestown several were buried last week with the disorder.” A constant theme in Hunt’s writing is, in fact, the fragility of life; stories of thunder (lightning) strikes, fires, drownings, sickness, and other mortal disasters are all duly noted. While Hunt made no reference to the issues behind the American Revolution, he did write that the soldiers occupied his meetinghouse several times and used it as a hospital. The armies attempted to impress Quaker wagons for the use of the troops. The sounds of the Battle of the Brandywine (fought in Chester County, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1777) and the Battle of Germantown (north of Philadelphia) were heard in New Jersey. Later the sounds of soldiers marching could be heard in the meetinghouse.
