            <p>
                It has latterly been much upon my mind to endeavor to answer thy truly acceptable letter which came to hand a few days after its date. On reading it my mind felt stirred up I trust I may say with Peter that the pure mind was sired up by way of remembrance. Thou expressed a desire that it might be currency and not counterfeit and I do believe thy desire was fully answered so much so that when I think of making a return I fear it will be below par. But there are many notes which pass with allowing discount on them which is some encouragement to me. Hoping thou will allow the discount and let it pass. My feelings were much interested in thy remarks on primitive plainness and simplicity. For when we see so many friends and a number too, of them in the foremost ranks in society, grasping hard after the emoluments and interests of this world and as they advance in wealth their offspring proportionately running into its fashions and embracing its maxims and becoming as it were strong men and women of the world, it is indeed cause of mourning. Seeing it was out of all these things <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> was called for the first call he had or that he records is. <quote>Thou see’st that young people go into vanity and old people into the earth, therefore thou must leave all forsake all and be as a stranger to all</quote> and now many of that dear man’s professed followers are returning into the earth and into vanity. We are now reading his writings in the evenings and other suitable times. My spirit often is engaged in earnest desires to to be induced with a portion of the precious spirit he was of, to labor in this our day, 
            
            <pb n="002" facs="457131"/>
            amongst those where my lot may be cast. He was in a wonderful manner eminently qualified to lay open the mystery of iniquity and the great deception of high professors practiced upon the people in that day. And to declare the truth amongst all sorts not shrinking or deviating from the paintings thereof for the sake of honor or for fear of dishonor. Well we live in a day in which much remains to be done although our worthy ancestors <add>have</add> done much very much and in this labor we all have a work a very important work assigned us, and notwithstanding so much has been done many remain in great darkness and ignorance. Laden as with thick clay in a state of great estrangedness from from that pure, holy, saving, principle of divine love <add>that is</add> bottomed upon the plan of unchangeable everlasting truth <note type="authorial" place="margin">the sentence should be reversed &amp; read, estrangedness from that plan of unchangeable everlasting truth that is bottomed upon the pure, holy, saving principle of divine love</note>. May we then earnestly endeavor to know our duties and do them, our places and keep them, this day I attended our monthly meeting at Gwynedd felt strong desires that all the members of it might consider the work the Lord’s work and not man’s and therefore humbly seek for his aid and assistance to transact the affairs of society for when the mind is not engaged in humble seeking, it is liable, very liable from its active nature to lay plans and form opinions altogether in the fallen will and wisdom of man. And hence the important concerns of society may be transacted in a lifeless superficial manner although there may be much art, oratory, and argument used. I am abundantly persuaded that if friends generally in meetings were fully convinced that divine

            help was really necessary and were engaged humbly to seek it that our meeting would be crowned with great solemnity we had however a good meeting today. And one of our young men laid before <add>it</add> a concern he had felt for some considerable time past to go and reside with the Indians and instruct them in some of the mechanic arts, he had some time previously laid his concern before the yearly meeting’s committee which was approved and left for a suitable time to move and a time now opening he was notified ; the concern obtained this feeling sympathy and unity of the meeting. He is a valuable precious spirited man and I believe feels it his religious duty to go, and I feel a secret hope his labor may be blessed amongst that poor afflicted race of men… I send enclosed some remarks of Governor Levingston on the clergy. I thought they might be interesting to <damage><supplied>thee</supplied></damage>. It was a disappointment to us that we did not get to <damage><gap/></damage> house when we were over at quarterly meeting. <damage><gap/></damage> the <damage><gap/></damage> of our return and the inclemency of the day prevented… It may be not amiss to remark to thee that when we were over before &amp; were at thy house that we did not return home until the the next first day week after. That we were at 22 meetings in Jersey, 6 of which were monthly meetings and 9 appointed the other 7 occurring on the regular meeting days, as thou looked back on our being together with pleasantness. So we may truly say thy fatherly company to us was grateful and I trust will ever be remembered by us. I feel glad that we were preserved through thy visit and can look back at it with peace of mind. My spirit feels nearly united to many dear friends in Jersey…Fare well please write in thy freedom to thy affectionate friend who will be glad to receive anything from thou
