<dateline><date when="1794-04-20">20 the 4 Month 1794</date></dateline><p> I was now preparing to set out for my journey to the Eastern Governments. I had the company of many friends for three days, and then, in great poverty of spirit, and in full unity, and near and dear love to and with my friends, I left my home, my wife going with me to my daughter’s or son-in-law Abraham’s, where I stayed all night.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-04-24/1794-04-29"><dateline><date from="1794-04-24" to="1794-03-29">24 the 4 Month</date></dateline><p> and then, believing the time was full come to take my leave of wife and all, we parted in near and dear love and I went on to Burlington, not knowing where I should be led next, for I said “who is so blind as thy servants and messengers.” Although poor as I was, had a favored meeting and felt an increase of strength. Went to John Wright’s, who went with me the next day towards Rahway. We lodged at Elijah Pound’s, having rode near forty miles. I was very weary and soon went to bed, but next morning felt refreshed. Had a solid time with the woman who seemed tendered for the most part. I felt very insufficient to the work before me, but, through divine aid, I had a little faith left in the all-sufficient arm of divine power that has preserved me hitherto. By traveling hard, we got to the meeting at Rahway, it being their Quarter. On first day, I went to Plainfield to a meeting held there. This was a favored meeting. And then returned to Rahway again and stayed till the meeting ended, which was the 29 day of the 4 month 1794</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-04-30"><dateline><date when="1794-04-30">30 the 4 month 1794</date></dateline><p> left Rahway and proceeded towards New York, where I arrived about noon. Took my dinner and then {went} in company with several friends. Went on board a boat and, about the tenth hour at night, arrived at Flushing. Got to our lodging. Was well received by friends here. I met my horse by a friend from New York</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-01"><dateline><date when="1794-05-01">1 the 5 month, 1794</date></dateline><p> this is their month meeting. It was a laborious meeting to me. This was a day of deep searching of heart, but through divine favor felt an inward support and quiet of mind. I stayed here till next day, poor in spirit</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-02"><dateline><date when="1794-05-02">2 the 5 month, 1794</date></dateline><p> here I left my horse and went to Westbury with a kind friend for such I have met with since I have left my home, to my admiration. Blessed be God for his mercies great to his poor servant.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-03"><dateline><date when="1794-05-03">3 the 5 month, 1794</date></dateline><p> this has been a day of renewed favor. I had several solid sittings in families, such as I believe truth owned. I wish I may be humbly thankful for the same to the great preserver of men from whom all good comes</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-04"><dateline><date when="1794-05-04">4 the 5 month, 1794</date></dateline><p> this day is first day. Was at Westbury meeting, which was very large and highly favored. Truth was over all. Blessed be God who bringeth down the lofty from their seats and exalteth them of low degree. I had some solid seasons in the afternoon in some families, there being youth and others.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-05"><dateline><date when="1794-05-05">5 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this morning am pretty well in health, and am favored with an inward quiet, which has been my support ever since I left my home. Though often in great poverty of spirit at times, yet have no cause to murmur. Had a meeting at Cow Neck, this was not large nor lively for want of more zeal, yet power was given to labor for the cause of truth.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-06"><pb n="2"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-05-06">6 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day I had a meeting at Matinecock, which was large and a solid good meeting. I felt such a degree of inward quiet that it is cause of thankfulness to the author of all good.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-07"><dateline><date when="1794-05-07">7 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting at Oyster Bay, which was very large. It consisted mostly of people not of our society. It was a favored meeting. The people appeared solid and quiet. From thence I went to Jericho.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-08"><dateline><date when="1794-05-08">8 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this meeting at Jericho was large, dull, and heavy because of a lukewarm spirit, but power was given to labor for the cause of truth in a close[?] way that seemed to be well received.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-09"><dateline><date when="1794-05-09">9 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting at Jerusalem. It was a very large meeting, mostly not of friends, but a solid, favored one I believe, to the tendering of many hearts. Blessed be God for his manifold mercies.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-10"><dateline><date when="1794-05-10">10 the 5 month</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at the Halfway Hollow [Half Hollow Hills?], not large, after which I had a solid opportunity in the family.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-11"><dateline><date when="1794-05-11">11 the 5 month</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Bethpage. This was large. It was an exercising time. I was almost ready to give out, but, having some solid sittings in families, seemed a little revived, but continues poor in spirit. I saw the necessity of keeping steady, favored or not, be things rough or smooth.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-12"><dateline><date when="1794-05-12">12 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Jacob Smith’s. This was large and thought to be a favored meeting. The largeness and solid sitting of the people was remarked, as they was mostly not friend, and where meetings were not usually held. I went from meeting to meeting as an empty vessel, but the Lord was pleased to fill my heart with life and power to labor for the exaltation of his great and glorious name who is God, over all blessed forever</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-13"><dateline><date when="1794-05-13">13 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting in a barn at Hempstead. This was also large, not many friend. Was a favored, good meeting. My mind seemed somewhat renewed in God our savior, who has been mouth and wisdom, tongue and utterance. I was enlarged at this time. I find the necessity after a time of favor to return to the king’s gate again, under an humbling sense of the goodness of God who keeps from sinking below hope.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-14"><dateline><date when="1794-05-14">14 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Westbury month meeting. This was large, but not lively. Lukewarmness prevailed. They seemed at ease in Zion and content.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-15"><dateline><date when="1794-05-15">15 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day Jericho month meeting. This morning pretty well in health. A good meeting. I am poor in spirit but feel an inward calm.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-16"><dateline><date when="1794-05-16">16 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at John Sering’s. Not large. It was long in gathering, but ended well.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-17"><dateline><date when="1794-05-17">17 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Rockaway. This was large and a solid good meeting. At this was but two members. Lhe Lord was pleased to be mouth and wisdom, tongue and utterance, blessed be his great name who is God over all, for human wisdom is not sufficient for thy work of Lord.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-18"><pb n="3"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-05-18">18 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Flushing first day meeting. I, with some solid friends of that meeting, did believe, when the meeting was left, well. A friend made some addition not to profit. This needs great and guarded care, so that from our desire to do good, we do harm. This I write for a caution.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-19"><dateline><date when="1794-05-19">19 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> visited a school. Had a solid opportunity, respecting several matters. This was well received though close[?].</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-20"><dateline><date when="1794-05-20">20 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> wad a meeting at Newtown. This was large and instructing. Here was but few friends. Here was a Presbyterian preacher who desired to have the liberty to speak, as something rested on his mind, and he thought not safe to quench the spirit, but no reply was made. What he had to say was, in substance, that he had been comforted in sitting with us, and fully united with the doctrine delivered, and requested a strict observation there unto, without which no man could be saved, for it was the doctrine of Christ himself, and as old as the creation, and could not be denied by any man. Let him profess what he will. He said he was thankful that he had been with us. I understand that he bore a good character, and a moderate man, but was never at a friends meeting before.</p></div>
 
<div type="entry" n="1794-05-21"><dateline><date when="1794-05-21">21 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at New York. This is their preparative meeting day. Some close[?] labor I had in this meeting, both with men and women, to keep a guarded care over all their conduct and conversation during the meeting, as now came on their yearly meeting, that the cause may not suffer, which they came about, nor the honest enquirer be turned out of the way by the liberty that may be taken by friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-22"><dateline><date when="1794-05-22">22 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> visited several families to my comfort in this city.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-23"><dateline><date when="1794-05-23">23 the 5 month</date></dateline><p> was writing and paid some religious visits in this city.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-24"><dateline><date when="1794-05-24">24 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is the select meeting before the yearly meeting of business came on.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-25"><dateline><date when="1794-05-25">25 first day</date></dateline><p> these meetings was large but not so lively as could be wished.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-26"><dateline><date when="1794-05-26">26 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> after solid pause the business opened and a little entered on.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-27"><dateline><date when="1794-05-27">27 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> on to the thirty-first, the meeting continued, and it was thought to have been a favored season, and much counsel given, both in men’s and women’s part very suitable to their state.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-05-31"><dateline><date when="1794-05-31">31 the 5 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day the meeting ended, and I felt poor in spirit and thought it safest to retire to my quarters and wait for further direction and counsel from God. What to do next and where to go?</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-01"><dateline><date when="1794-06-01">1 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> went on board the boat at New York the eighth hour for Flushing. Had a good passage. Got to the meeting in good season. It was large and favored.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-02"><dateline><date when="1794-06-02">2 the 6 month</date></dateline><p> this morning crossed the bay to the mainland and was at Westbury meeting. Not large, rather laborious, but ended well. Here met me Hugh Judge and James Mott.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-03">
<pb n="4"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-06-03">3 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Mamaroneck meeting. This was large and favored. In my passing along I had many solid opportunities in families.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-04"><dateline><date when="1794-06-04">4 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Purchase Meeting. This large, but low and dull. It is their preparative. Here was a number of plain dressed friends, but life and zeal for truth’s cause was wanting. Ease and lukewarmness prevailed amongst the fore rank. I had some close[?] work amongst them but ended well.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-05"><dateline><date when="1794-06-05">5 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this morning set out for Rhode Island. It was a trying season, for I was unwell, and felt something of my fits and having near two hundred miles to ride and no friends. On the way caused me to look towards my close[?]. This was more for the trial of my faith than any other way, as I believe, for after riding for forty seven miles that day felt my strength renewed, faith and love to God increased. Blessed be his great name and that forever.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-06"><dateline><date when="1794-06-06">6 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day held my journey beyond my expectation. Had many deep and serious thoughts, as my way was in an uncommon manner, and my appearance, and to the people this was trying to the first nature, but I remembered what I preached to the people: not to be ashamed of the Cross of Christ, nor to deny him before men, but let them that mock, mock on, but mind thee thy business, and that is enough for thee, and he was pleased to make hard things easy and bittersweet. I feel an inward calm. Blessed be God</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-07"><dateline><date when="1794-06-07">7 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day proceeded on my way. The road is very stony. Went about thirty miles to a friend’s house. This was a comfort to my weary body.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-08"><dateline><date when="1794-06-08">8 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> went to Stonington [Hopkinton?] meeting. This consisted not of friends, but mostly of other people. I clearly saw the necessity of a fresh supply of daily bread from heaven, for human wisdom will not do for the Lord’s work, this I am clear in. Great is my stripping at this time, and poverty of soul, but feel better.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-09"><dateline><date when="1794-06-09">9 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day was at Westerly meeting. Very small. Thought by the reason of the wetness of the day. Had a solid time in the family where I lodged.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-10"><dateline><date when="1794-06-10">10 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Richmond meeting. The woman where I lodged lost not the benefit of her friends’ company by being anxious in providing for them, but came, and her girls, and sat with us in a solid manner, and yet had enough to eat and some to spare. This I write for encouragement to women [D: this anecdote occurs on 6/9/1794]</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-11"><dateline><date when="1794-06-11">11 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day was at West Kingstown meeting. Large, and after had several solid seasons in families.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-12"><dateline><date when="1794-06-12">12 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at South Kingstown meeting. Large but long in gathering. Four of these last in Narragansett.</p>
<p>this afternoon crossed two rivers three miles each. Got to Newport, here my beloved friend Thomas Robinson met me as soon as I came on shore, and took me to his house where I quartered during the yearly meeting which lasted five day. In this I visited Portsmouth on first day this was large and favored.</p>
<p>The yearly meeting was a low exercising time; by that it ended I was poor in spirit. At my friend Thomas Robinson’s, I had a comfortable lodging, himself, wife, and daughter Abigail being as kind as I could wish, and company agreeable.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-17"><pb n="5"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-06-17">17 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this morning, the yearly meeting ended and I went back across one of these rivers before mentioned to a little island called Canonicut, where I lodged this night.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-18"><dateline><date when="1794-06-18">18 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Canonicut. The house was not large, but much crowded. It was thought that some of every family was there that lived on the island. It was a solid good meeting. In the afternoon, crossed to Newport and so to Jacob Mott.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-19"><dateline><date when="1794-06-19">19 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day, crossed a small ferry, had a meeting at Tiverton, this being wet day the number not large.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-20"><dateline><date when="1794-06-20">20 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Little Compton. This was very large so that the passage ways was full of people standing, and some could not get into the house. The people was very solid and quiet. After the meeting came many, both young and old not of our society, to where we dined. We had a solid sitting with them, at which there was several of them were broken into tears and much tendered. We had cause to bless, magnify, and praise the Lord. We parted in feeling love.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-21"><dateline><date when="1794-06-21">21 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at New Rochelle, this large. The house could not hold the people. They was solid and quiet.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-22"><dateline><date when="1794-06-22">22 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting at Center. Large, and, in the afternoon at Newtown, this was large and a good meeting.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-23"><dateline><date when="1794-06-23">23 the 6 month</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Apponaganset. Not as large as the others.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-24"><dateline><date when="1794-06-24">24 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at New Bedford. This was dully and heavy, by reason of a lukewarm, drowsy spirit this prevailed amongst the foremost rank, to my grief.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-25"><dateline><date when="1794-06-25">25 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Long Plains, and in the afternoon at Acushnet. These was very large.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-26"><dateline><date when="1794-06-26">26 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> went on board the vessel in great poverty of spirit at New Bedford, bound for Nantucket. Sixty miles by water. The first day there was but little wind, and that contrary, and the tide ahead. As there was a place of danger, and the tide low so that it was not safe to pass, we laid at anchor for several hours, till the tide made in our favor. We was called on deck, as there was no wind, we must put out the oars, for now was the time at high water to pass the place of danger. We passed safe, but what little wind there was, yet contrary. The captain, as night was near, thought best to run into an harbor. I now began to think myself Jonah-like, and so it proved, for in this harbor was a little town that I must visit that evening. And the next day, the wind blew fair. We got to Nantucket just as the select meeting began. This was a favored season, 27 of 6 month.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-28"><dateline><date when="1794-06-28">28 the 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is their monthly meeting. It was large. I had a solid time, both with men and women, to their and my comfort.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-06-29"><dateline><date when="1794-06-29">29 6 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is first day. Was at two meetings. Very large, solid, and quiet. The thirtieth was their select meeting, small but favored.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-01"><dateline><date when="1794-07-01">1 the 7 month</date></dateline><p> this their quarter at this time. Had another solid season, both with men and women, for business, for many things had crept in amongst parents and children, to wounding the cause of truth and their hurt.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-02"><pb n="6"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-07-02">2 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is their quarterly meeting day. In the afternoon had a select meeting with parents and heads of families. This was not for public worship. I had some close[?] work. There was a large number and, to outward appearance, solid and plain, but the life and power was wanting.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-03"><dateline><date when="1794-07-03">3 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting in the forenoon at the other house, {of course}, there being two in this town Nantucket. In the afternoon with the young women, had a meeting. Here was a large number. This was an humbling time not to be forgot.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-04"><dateline><date when="1794-07-04">4 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had three meetings. The first, at the eighth hour in the morning, with the young men. This was large but not so favored. There seemed much rawness and insensibility of real good.</p>
<p>Again, at the second hour in the afternoon, with the black, both Negroes and Indians, as they are much mixed in this place. This large and to satisfaction.</p>
<p>The fifth hour this day with those that was not members of any religious society, and such others as chose to come. This was very large and favored, I believe held to the honor of the cause of truth and much to my comfort.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-05"><dateline><date when="1794-07-05">5 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day had no meeting, but rode out about six miles to visit a friend and had a solid time in the family. And on our return, saw an herd of cows coming from pasture, all through one pair of bars, to the number of near five hundred. They being fed on large commons. There is but little fence on this island. They plant corn not fenced. These herdsmen tend the cattle, for here lies many thousand acres of land that has no fence at all. I never saw such a sight.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-06"><dateline><date when="1794-07-06">6 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is first day. Had two meetings this afternoon. I visited several aged, sick, and infirm to their comfort.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-07"><dateline><date when="1794-07-07">7 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day took my leave of friends on Nantucket in near feeling love, and went on board a vessel, and went thirty miles by water to what is called the Vineyard, it being an island. I was some sick. We landed at a place called Holmes’ Hole, and went to William Coffin’s.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-08"><dateline><date when="1794-07-08">8 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this morning, I am poor in spirit, and see but little how things may turn, but think best to be still, and say but little, and let the Lord do as seemeth good to him, for human wisdom is not sufficient to direct our ways. We had a meeting here, but not large, though solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-09"><dateline><date when="1794-07-09">9 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this morning, went in a boat by water to a place called Woods’ Hole.

We rode 8 miles this day.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-07-10"><dateline><date when="1794-07-10">10 the 7 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Falmouth. This was said by some to be the largest they ever saw at this place. The people sat solid.</p></div>

At the close I requested Benjamin Bump and his members would stay, and the others withdraw. This was no small trial to Benjamin, for they all left him but three men and three women. We had a solid time that seemed well taken, and, after we had dined, went and visited Benjamin and wife, and was well satisfied, though things was laid close[?], yet well received. We parted in love. They signified their satisfaction.</p></div>

I had some close[?] labor, such as I thought would hardly be born well. But, not being clear, requested friends and others to meet again at the fourth hour, {and, if they pleased,} to give notice to all the town, if they pleased. I was informed the governor, living in this place, went himself to inform the people. Although stormy, yet a large gathering, and solid. It was a favored time. Some close[?] doctrine was delivered that was well taken by the people. They learned to live in high life, and full of pride. Then had a solid sitting with friends to our comfort. This was a trying day, but I believe ended well, and to the honor of the cause of truth.</p></div>

The above Friends were visited by our esteemed Joshua Evans from the 17th PM to the 23rd AM of the 7 mo. 1794, accompanied by his Friends Deborah Davis, Caleb Green, Thomas Rotch, and Charity Rotch. Through the several sittings in said families, the ownings of divine favor was in a good degree evidenced, friends were, in general, mostly solid in attending to the cautious counsel and invitations to endeavor to come out of the several deep rooted customs so prevalent amongst us, to the hindrance and obstructing the work of reformation and regeneration and by preventing any fourth progress or introduction of those things which tend to leaven the mind into the customs and fashions of the world, not only to prevent but to put away such as may be removed out of sight. That our women Friends whose province it is to order the house may get together, endeavor to unite, consider, and confer on the important subject: what may be {do} necessary to be done in order as effectually as may be to remove those things and to strengthen each other’s hands to encourage the youth in the paths and piety and virtue, that the next generation may be such as may be instrumental in advancing the cause and testimony of truth in the world, which must be by way of the cross,

The above named Families (most all of them belonging to no religious society, were visited by our beloved Friend Joshua Evans from the morning of the 11th to the evening of the 12th of the 8 mo. 1794, accompanied by his companion and us. A good degree of weight and solemnity attended most of the families and the encouraging communications, counsel, and advices (of our esteemed Friend) were kindly received (to the tendering of many hearts), which was not to seek the law at the priest’s lips, but turn the mind inward to the teachings of free grace given to all etc. Through the several sittings, the ownings of divine favor was in a good degree evidenced, we believe, to the edification and comfort of many honest enquirers, of which there seems to be a considerable number here, and having so freely united with him in spirit according to our measures that we feel desirous to give a testimony thereof—

There had another meeting under a tree, as the weather was very warm. These were large and favored. Here was a man that never had been at a friend’s meeting before.

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-08"><dateline><date when="1794-08-08">8 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this, the select members met and had a favored time of parting. I then informed them of some further prospects I had in view, though out of the common way, with which they did unite, and after had a meeting on a little island called Prudence. Here was a few friends lived. The river was three miles wide. This was a favored time.</p></div>

Was at eleven families this day. They appeared as sheep without a shepherd and sincere seekers of Zion’s ways. Their solid sitting and tenderness was a comfort to my heart.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-12"><dateline><date when="1794-08-12">12 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> I continued my visit to ten families, not quite so solid, this. This evening had a sitting with all those tender people who chose to come. This was such a time of favor as will not ever be forgot, I believe, by these poor things. It was like a farewell season. They seemed as though we could not part. Much solid counsel was given and well taken to my comfort. We parted in near love and unity.</p></div>

In the afternoon visited three ministers, not friends. We was kindly received, but my prospect was not answered, for I wanted these that was the leaders of the people to labor for a reformation, for in this place was great dissipation and liberty. But I found their hands was tied, for they looked to the people for their maintenance, and they was bound to please the public, priests and people was alike.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-16"><dateline><date when="1794-08-16">16 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day forenoon, visited three more ministers. They received me very kindly. In the afternoon, visited the governor of Rhode Island and first judge of that place and one of the senators. These visits was on the aforesaid account of the dissipation that prevailed in the town of Providence. I thought these that stood as at the helm of government might have great influence, but their hands was also weak, though they acknowledged a reformation was wanting. I wished them to make a beginning, both by precept and example, and not to be seen where these thing were, so as to give countenance to them. I did believe the youth might be helped, they said they {my labor} hoped my labor would not all be lost. We parted in near love and if I came that way to pay them another visit.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-17"><dateline><date when="1794-08-17">17 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this first day had a meeting Old Smithfield, and another. In the afternoon had a meeting at Cumberland in a Baptist meeting house at their request. These was large and solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-22"><dateline><date when="1794-08-22">22 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> was at Leicester meeting. This was favored.

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-25"><dateline><date when="1794-08-25">25 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> rode to Boston. Had no meeting. This is a day of darkness and inward poverty. The town is so noisy that I think it is a poor place for friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-26"><dateline><date when="1794-08-26">26 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Boston in the town. This was small and dull. This was said the most orderly that had been seen in this place. In the evening had all the members together, not more than twenty. This was a favored season.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-08-27"><pb n="12"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-08-27">27 the 8 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Lynn. Was large and laborious. It is proposed to have another meeting with friends by themselves at the fifth hour this afternoon. This was large and favored.</p></div>

We lodged at a friend’s that once had been baptized, but, to his great disappointment, instead of its ministering life it ministered death.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-03"><dateline><date when="1794-09-03">3 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Dover. This was large and favored. I, as I am writing, I feel a caution, having so many favored seasons, but I must give God the praise, for I may say in truth there is none to me. For never man could be more stripped than I am as I pass from meeting, in so much that, when I look to the grave, it look pleasant if my days work was done. But must not murmur. But all is in wisdom, and best for me to know nothing, for human wisdom and study is not sufficient for the Lord’s work, for we are too short sighted.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-04"><dateline><date when="1794-09-04">4 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Kittery in the forenoon and another in the afternoon. These not large and low, yet some labor was bestowed.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-05"><dateline><date when="1794-09-05">5 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Berwick. This was a time of so great favor as not soon to be forgot. It was large. The people showed me much respect, and many of them wanted to know when I should come that way again, and when I was going. Many of them, to take leave of me and wished me good success in their way this afternoon, rode twenty miles.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-06"><dateline><date when="1794-09-06">6 the 9 month</date></dateline><p> this day rode forty eight miles to Durham in the depth of poverty, not knowing how the Lord would be pleased to dispose of me next.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-07"><dateline><date when="1794-09-07">7 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Durham on first day. This was large but a poor, low time. My soul was deeply baptized under a sense of the appearance of things in these parts so that I slept little this night. My cries was to the Lord for wisdom to direct, for I saw my own was not sufficient in this time of trial. Blessed be his great name forever.</p></div>
 
<div type="entry" n="1794-09-08"><dateline><date when="1794-09-08">8 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Lewiston. This was small. At the close[?] I requested the members to stay. We had a favored time, though the number was but like two or three.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-09"><pb n="13"/>
<dateline><date when="1794-09-09">9 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Greene. This was small. This was a poor, low time. At the close[?] I informed them I was willing to meet them again at the third hour this afternoon. This was a little better, and at the close the members, at my request, came together. This was a favored time. The meeting was held in a little log house covered with bark.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-10"><dateline><date when="1794-09-10">10 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day rode twenty miles to Winthrop. In this journey, so far, I held so well that I had cause to marvel at the goodness of God to me, a poor creature, to him be ascribed a praise.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-11"><dateline><date when="1794-09-11">11 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at this place. It was large and exercising. The people seemed on the decline. As to the better part, my spirit seemed to fail in this remote place. And their titles for their lands no better, but gained by war by their forefathers, or first settlers of this country.</p>
<p>The same day was informed that, from this place, the natives was drove off by the point of the sword. This was a great exercise to my mind, for it seemed to me as though they cared not how they came by their lands, so they had it. I believe a day of trial would come sooner or later. I could not see how truth could prosper under so great wickedness, but they held it out of sight, but alas alas, this is far from the golden rule of doing to others as we would be done unto, for that which they bought was for such a trifle that it was almost as nothing. Nine bushels of corn and some some small trifles for thirty miles square. This they held as the fairest, when much of the rest was taken by the point of the sword. How friends could live on such land and be at ease I know not.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-12"><dateline><date when="1794-09-12">12 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> traveled twenty miles to Fairfield. This is the farthest meeting up the Kennebec River, six hundred miles from my home. A rough country and wilderness. The people fair hard and houses poor.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-13"><dateline><date when="1794-09-13">13 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had two meetings at this place: one for all societies and the other with friends by themselves. These large and favored, with power to labor for truth’s cause in both these. Much close[?] doctrine was delivered that seemed well taken by all sorts.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-09-14"><dateline><date when="1794-09-14">14 the 9 month 1794</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at the same place.

<floatingText>Beloved Friend,
I, having it on my mind several weeks past to visit thy wife and children, and little flock at Newtown meeting, and now write this at thy house after meeting the 29th of the 6 mo. 1794. The meeting (thy wife says was smaller than common) and much like many others now a days. Close, hard labor fore part. Before we can get through an indolent spirit, which too much prevails. However, I hope it ended well at last.
Thy dear wife expressed a gladness as we were riding together to meeting alone, and said it seemed a little like having thee with her. Abraham’s letter will inform further concerning her and the children. The accounts I have heard from thee have been very satisfactory and tends much to the confirmation of my mind in the belief that thou art in thy proper place. I often think of thee, and sometimes am almost ready to wish I was with thee, if I dare; however I have often thought it would have been very pleasant to me if way had opened for it, or that it had been so ordered, and I desire to be remembered by thee—friends here have divers times. Enquired after thee, but I have not seen thy letter, and have heard but little though. That little has been very comfortable and gives encouragement to hope that thou will be preserved and helped along. And as far as I can discover, it would be very acceptable to all thy friends to have thee return (when thou art clear though it were with thy beard on; for I think it is more plain to be discovered amongst thy friends now than ever, that thou hast left something like a sweet smell and a delectable savor which may be looked upon as a great favor, to be so far preserved, and now in a fair way, I hope to fill up thy days work in the day time, so as to receive the answer of well done at last; is the desire of thy friend whose love and regard, time nor distance has not diminished in the least.

Much Beloved Friend					Epping 10 mo. 20th 1794
	Although I {h}am, in some measure, sensible of my unfitness to salute thee in any way that may be satisfactory, yet thought it would yield me some satisfaction in this unexpected event of thy going out of these parts without seeing thee again, for indeed I did not think so much about a final parting, but what I held: a secret thought of seeing thee again. And now could I see that it could be with consistency, I should propose meeting thee at Pittsfield tomorrow. But as things now are, I can’t see how I can break out {and} through them, but must submit to my allotment and deserved probation, to think of thy going out of our parts so soon before we grow.
Any better is an addiction to my discouragements, for if every leaning stock is removed, and the staff also taken away, how shall poor I ever pattern after a Joshua so as effectually to take up the resolution of serving the Lord. But thus much I believe. If no more, thy company will do convince us whereabouts we are, and what we might have been had we been more like thee in coming up in faithfulness to what has been discovered by the same spirit, and less like unfaithful Saul, who made exceptions of things called to be destroyed, and for others who have not, who have not so grossly offended as I fear I have. It doubtless will help them on their way, so that I rejoice. Thou hast trod the wearisome path of sojourning amongst us, and believe thou has not labored in vain, and now, in a measure of that love that filled my heart towards thee at my first being in thy company, which was a larger portion than I could expect to have enjoyed, do I affectionately bid thee farewell, wishing to be remembered by thee as a poor child, if thou can find me deserving of it in the least.

<div type="entry" n="1794-10-26"><dateline><date when="1794-10-26">26 the 10 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is first day. Was at the meeting at Hailstown. This was the third at this place.

<div type="entry" n="1794-10-27"><dateline><date when="1794-10-27">27 the 10 month 1794</date></dateline><p> went to visit a young woman in weak state of health whose parents was very rich and had brought her up in a delicate way. It was thought the cause of her weakness, as she said if her mother had let her run out as poor children did, it had been better for her. She being the only daughter, her mother wanted her to be something more than common poor children, and is likely to shorten her days. This I write as a warning to parents not to be too finical in bringing up children. The storm continues.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-10-28"><dateline><date when="1794-10-28">28 the 10 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day rode thirty-five miles towards Richmond. This is a mountainous way, and very stony. My soul, at times, did almost fail within me to see the towering height of the mountains. And poor me, as a pilgrim, this night lodged at a tavern, where we was well entertained. I thought the man might have been convinced of our principles. I thought him an honest enquirer. I gave him a friends book. He said he liked it well. He had not seen one before this. He took kind. We had some solid conversation on the doctrine of things being fore ordained. This was so imbibed, he said it would be hard to get over. I was well satisfied. My lot was cast their. I believe he was an honest man. He sold no spirituous liquors, though a tavern keeps.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-10-29"><dateline><date when="1794-10-29">29 the 10 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this forenoon reached Richmond. The road continues rough and hilly. For the most part, I feel some better in spirit, but weak in body.</p></div>

This was an exercising day, and a day of great stripping of spirit. The adversary of all good was busy with his presentations. How ever good the Lord was, he the enemy would try to make me believe {they} that the Lord was laying a trap to chastise me the more severe, and that I had done little or no good in all my journey. But he is a liar, and the truth is not in him, I found him to be, so I write this for the encouragement of them, so tried to put their trust in the Lord alone in times of poverty, for he is good. Blessed be his great and glorious name, saith my soul.</p></div>

I had a time of clost[?] labor in the women’s part in pleading for the cause of God against superfluities of various sorts, such as fine houses, rich furniture, and gaudy apparel, the free use of the tea table, and large looking glasses, silk black cloaks, as also silk of all sorts in this country, but to use flax and wool, and that of their own spinning, for to bring up our children in a course of industry is consistent with our principles, and best for the health and constitutions of our children, for idle rest produces luxury, and luxury many diseases both of body and soul.</p></div>

Here the extracts came under consideration and the weighty matters therein contained was well digested in a lively manner, both in men’s and women’s meeting, which I attended. Where was dropped many pertinent hints with respect to placing out children to improper places, and employing and introducing persons of loose principles and immoral conduct, and the youth copying after the vain fashions and customs of the world in their dress, address, and general deportment as also superfluity in house furniture, these thing being advised from the yearly meeting. And I remarked these things: large looking glasses, tea tables, as all foreign trade such as silk and fine linen, and to bring up children in a course of industry, the rich as well as the poor, so that they may know how, in straitened circumstance, to help themselves by their own labor. If they should be left widows with fatherless children, or in a far country where no father nor mother to look to, when instead of sumptuous fair now a scanty pattern.</p></div>

This was a great trial to me but every cup has its dregs, except the cup of salvation. That is sweet and clear to the bottom, where is no sorrow. Although, since I left my home, many was gone to the silent grave, and others gone out of the right way, yet blessed be the Lord, whose almighty power is a sure rock and refuge and safe sheltering place were the righteous flee and are safe. I feel it to be so, and am thankful, feeling an inwardly calm in the midst of this storm.</p></div>

In times of deep baptism, my soul could say “great and marvelous are thy works” of Lord God all mighty, and just and true are all thy way, thou king of kings, for thou wast with me through a long and trying journey of near eight months, as a poor pilgrim, and one that had none inheritance in this world, through a rough mountainous country. I believe in thy work and service to the comfort of many honest hearted friends, as there is a large number in New England, from Rhode Island to Fairfield, about three hundred miles. Here is a solid body of plain, kind friends as I ever saw, from the 8 to the 13.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1794-12-14"><dateline><date when="1794-12-14">14 the 12 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this is another trying day, every way. Only this, the Lord’s power, was at my right hand, and my bow renewed, to make war in righteousness. This was first day. I had given me the word of the Lord to declare. This I did faithfully at Newtown, the meeting to which I belonged, as I was now returned home to. My inward peace continues with me. {that} The word I had to deliver was, on this, worse, that I saw many dead bodies lying, who was poisoned with the dregs of the syrup of the spirit of this world. This struck a solemn calm and deep silence.</p></div>

I had some deep hidden dark things opened, where the enemy and adversary, the devil, had put it in the hearts of my son and his wife, to conceal having got to the bottom, the opening of which was so striking to my son that it had liked to have taken his life, for he thought he had hit it in so dark a hole as it would never be revealed, but the devil did deceive him, to his astonishment, as he said. This I write as a warning to all others, not to serve the adversary, the devil, for he will most assuredly deceive them, for he is a liar, and the truth is not in him [significant revisions in this entry and the previous two between journals].</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-12-18"><dateline><date when="1794-12-18">18 the 12 month 1794</date></dateline><p> this day was our fifth day meeting. It was a large, favored season. I was led to set forth the difference between an earthly store house and an heavenly. One was nothing, and the other all thing. In a dying hour, to have something laid up that will go with us beyond the grave, and that at such a time that there is no name little enough to call it by, neither can pay a ransom for the soul. Be sure, my beloved friends, be willing to come under the government of the good spirit, and then nothing can hurt you, for all will be well come life or death.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1794-12-19"><dateline><date when="1794-12-19">19 the 12 month 1794</date></dateline><p> I behold the smiles of a pleasant day, but this is a changeable world and full of trouble, but in Christ Jesus is peace, yea substantial peace that leaves no sorrow.

This gave me some comfort. I informed him, as that which was past could not be reconciled, I felt as to my self disposed {to} upon his good behavior to pass all by, and look forward, for it must be his good behavior that would bring him into favor again. I would wish him to look no other way, for he had transgressed, and done that which was very wrong. He said he was sensible of that. It was as much as he could bear. Through all I feel that inward quiet that keeps my head above the flood.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1794-12-26"><dateline><date when="1794-12-26">26 the 12 month 1794</date></dateline><p> visited several families to my comfort. I thought if we could lay aside rum and tea, it would be a great step towards the work of the reformation. These hints seemed striking to those present, but I advised to look towards our ancient worthies, who had a testimony against these things. Fathers, mothers, grandfathers, and grandmothers, who are in their silent graves, the remembrance of these does my soul good, and is as marrow to my bones, and strength to my sinews. Their solid sitting in meetings was loud, preaching to me in this yearly time of life, and not forgot.</p></div>

And he saw the emptiness of this world, and it was as nothing to him now, but the welfare of his soul now was all. This I feared he was not sensible of, for he was a great warling[?]. He had several hard spells that had not weaned him {the things of} from this world as also another, whose age and infirmity might have weaned him from the breast of this world, but he hanged too, till old age seemed as if it must cut him asunder, for, according to the course of nature, he must soon leave it all and die.</p></div>

And it must be so, for what are we: poor, finite beings? That we should grieve thy holy spirit and contend one with the other about our temporal affairs, and extort one from each other, and, in an especial manner, when thou art speaking, thy rode in tender mercies over the inhabitants of the land, and, withholding the increase of the earth, which is thine to give or withhold.</p>
<p>Crops of grain are now much less, by reason of a blast or mildew. Thou sendest the worms and the flies. These things, believe, are because of the iniquities of the people, for the people are become rich by the abundance of their trade, their sons and their daughters finical and proud. They are taught to live by extortion, and unjust gain. They that are rich oppress the poor by extortion. The farmer raiseth the price of the produce of the ground. Because of the smallness of its increase, the laborer complaineth of the of the extortion of the farmer. The laborer raiseth his wages in order to get bread for his children. The employer is angry with the laborer, so here cometh in discord and envy and hatred.</p>
<p>the merchant is fishing in the muddy water, for the greater unsettlement, the wider the door is open for him to increase his wealth, and to make slaves of all the people.</p>
<p>when bread corn is now double, and everything in great confusion, humility banished out of this land in too immoral a way, the youth not brought up in a course of industry, but they must be doctors, lawyers, or traders.

Will the Lord not {hold} gag[?] these guilty, and, in his displeasure, turn them into outer darkness, where the wicked dwell to be tormented, and that forever and ever? Turn ye, turn ye. Why will ye die inhabitants of this once favored land, America? America, repent, repent, and wash thy cloths in incense, least he blot out thy name from under heaven. My soul mourneth within me, when I think of the shortness of time in this world, before we must die and leave it all, and step out of time into long and endless eternity, there to dwell forever. {that} What we now are so eagerly pursuing, it is vainly of vanities. All is vanity. The golden rule is to do as we would be done unto. The scarcity of any thing the poor stands in need of is not a sufficient rule to extort from them that they have gained by hard labor. This is now our miserable situation. Oh Lord, sound the trumpet louder and louder that so the inhabitants may be alarmed, and their souls be saved.</p></div>

In these cases I gave them some advice, and so returned to my daughters.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-01-24">24 the 1 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day, came home from my daughters through a stormy day and, in the afternoon, read part of an Indian treaty held in the year 1744, which I think proper to insert a part it is as follows.</p>
<quote><p>Held at the town of Lancaster in Pennsylvania, 1744, by the Lieutenant Governor of the province, and the commissioners of the province of Maryland and Virginia with the Indians of the six nations:</p>
<p>The governor and the commissioners took some of the Indians chiefs by the hand and, after they had seated themselves, the governor bid them welcome into the government.</p>
<p>I shall only mention a few things that strikes my mind with sorrow to think how unfaithful the English have been after so many fair promises.</p>
<p>Friends and brethren, sachems, or chiefs of the Indians of the six nations, these your brethren of Virginia and Maryland are come to enlarge the friendship with you which it is their desire may last so long as the sun, the moon, and the stars shall give light, and be you with them as one body and one soul.</p>
<p>The Indians now speaks as follows: when you mentioned the affair of the land yesterday, you went back to old times, and told us you had been in possession of the province of Maryland above one hundred years. But what is one hundred years in comparison of the length of time since our claim began, since we came out of this ground? For we must tell you that long before one hundred years our ancestors came out of this very ground, and their children have remained here ever since. You came out of the ground in a country that lies beyond the seas. There you may have a just claim, but here you must allow us to be your elder brethren, and the lands to belong to us long before you knew anything of them. It is true that about one hundred years ago the Dutch came here in a ship and brought with them several goods, such as awls, knives, hatchets, guns, and many other particulars which they gave us. We saw what sort of people they were. We were so well pleased with them that we tied their ship to the bushes on the shore (and least it should not be secure, they removed it from time to time), to the trees, and to the rocks, and to the mountains, and fastened it with wampum, and sat on it, and stood thereon to defend and make it secure. During all this time the newcomers, the Dutch, acknowledged our right to the land, and solicited us from time to time to grant them part of our country, and to enter into league and covenant with us, and to become one people. After this, the English came into the country. About two years after the arrival of the English, they desired to be upon as good terms with us as the Dutch were with whom he was, and to become one people with us. And by his further care in looking into what had passed between us, he found that the rope which tied the ship to the great mountain was only fastened with wampum, which was liable to break or rot, and to perish in a course of years. He therefore told us he would give us a silver chain which would</p></quote>

For such a time I had experienced her innocent countenance was a comfort to me, and although her removal would be a great loss to her dear children as she has several yet, it will be her great gain, therefore no cause of mourning, for who is so near and dear to us that we would not be willing to give them up to go to heaven?</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-01-28"><dateline><date when="1795-01-28">28 the 1 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day I find an act made for regulating Indian affairs:</p>
<quote><p>that from and after the publication of this act, if any person or persons within this colony shall give or sell to any Indian or Indians any strong liquors, whereby they become intoxicated, or more than one quart of beer or cider, or half a gill of rum, or any other spirit in one day to any one Indian, except there be apparent necessity for so doing, he, she, or they so doing shall forfeit and pay for each time, the sum of twenty shillings. And that if any sale be made by any Indian within the colony, and any part of the consideration be paid in strong liquors more than by this act is allowed to be sold to such Indian, the sale of such goods is hereby declared void, and the property not altered hereby. And that every pledge or pawn given by any Indian for drink shall, upon complaint, be delivered up to him by order of any one Justice of the peace.</p>
<p>3 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that every debt which shall be contracted by any Indian for strong drink shall be esteemed null and void.</p></quote>
<p>I think this was much to the credit of the rulers at that time, although that law was only for two years, yet it is worthy our remembrance, and I wish it may not be forgot by succeeding generations, as long as there is Indians and white people in this country, that so a blessing may attend us both.</p></div>

I am informed of the death of Mary Cooper, wife of Marmaduke, who I believe lived an innocent life, and I hope died in the same, and, as I told her I had a belief she would go where she would know no more sorrow, and although she left a flock of small children, yet no cause of sorrow on her part.</p></div>

Therefore, never let me murmur, but swell under an humbling sense of thy gracious goodness. I also visited a young man on a sick bed. He expressed himself as followeth. <q>I am as I expect on a death bed. I feel very different from what I did in a time of health, when, amongst the gay-dressed, light-spirited people, what I then thought was or could in my one speculation or human wisdom merit and trusted in, was a charitable and favorable opinion of professors of all sorts, and a tolerable course of morality. But, now as I expect I am on a death bed, I find it is as nothing without the life and power of truth. I feel very much at a loss, for that which I now want, that is an inward assurance of the favor of God. This I find now comes not by any human wisdom, but is the gift of God. I sometimes do feel, for a few minutes, a degree of inward sweetness, but it is soon taken away again, and the thoughts in my sleep is very afflicting, for I often dream of being with my old sort of company, their merry way of drinking, of wine laughing, and making merry is now a great affliction to me.</q></p> 
<p><q>If I could but now have an assurance that I might go well, although young, I should be willing to die.</q> He expressed these words and much more with tears flowing from his eyes. Oh that this may be a warning to all to make a good use of the time of health, and not to leave a work of so much importance to so late a period as a sick bed and dying hour! I had a hope the Lord would not shut the door of mercy against him.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-02-13"><dateline><date when="1795-02-13">13 the 2 month 1795</date></dateline><p> there appears a sweet calm to attend in the opening of this day. On my way towards Woodbury quarterly meeting, where I lodged, we had some clost[?] conversation. As we differed in sentiment, I was of the belief that tea and coffee, with its attendance, had done as much hurt take the country, through as rum. Although rum, to a few that had a weakness, that way had done a great deal of mischief and, consequently, had been their ruin, and they have wasted that they and their wives and children should live on.</p>
<p>But has not gadding abroad, and tea drinking with their formal visits been the ruin of as many, and set them as far of the favor of God, and wasted their living in folly, and vanity, and, by their custom, done in more to their hurt for idolatry, is as bad if not worse than drunkenness?</p>
<p>I think it has been as great a grief to my mind, the free uses of tea and coffee as ever it was, when I was among the drunkards. For I thought they were as great to the stranger simplicity of the truth, and as far from God as the greatest drunkard that I saw. When they was handing it about, the rum on their servers, when I have seen this, I have been ready as one did in a similar case to say, “hear oh heavens, {and give ear} and be astonished, oh earth, at the extravagancy of the people!” When every poor cottage must have its tea ware, oh the expense! The country is at for tea ware and its attendance, and the excess, that it has got to that, many conclude that they cannot live without it no more than the drunkard can without rum. Only behold the cups and saucers they drink it out of. What are they? Do not they witness against the tea drinker and all its attendance with this language abominable idolatry accompanied with that pride that is offensive in the sight of the most high?</p>
<p>Oh, how the custom has over spread this land, that every poor person, even to the very out, inhabitance is captivated therewith.</p></div>

Here I had to mention my prospect of friends filling such high stations, having such broad collars, to great coats, but that we might be good examples at such times. For it was too just a reflection that friends children, when they came up to our quarterly meetings, frequently carried home some new fashions.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-02-18">18 the 2 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning arose with great bitterness of soul, and, as I had spent much of the night lamenting the backsliding of my children and their departure from the simplicity of the truth, this at times seems as though it would bring down my head with sorrow to the grave.</p></div>

The people sat very solid. I believe the meeting ended well, this is cause of humble thankfulness.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-02-21"><dateline><date when="1795-02-21">21 the 2 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited some sick and deeply afflicted. One of these had so perverse a wife, although her husband had for some time been confined to his bed, she told me she had not been in his room for more than a week. I told her I was ashamed to hear her say so. I told her I could not tell what could have hindered me from seeing my wife for so long a time when in the same house and on a sick bed. I wish this to be a warning, both to men and women, both husbands and wives, not to lose their love to each other, and guard against words that might better be spared.</p></div>

So, to feel as a poor pilgrim and sojourner, the iniquities of the people are very great, and sin aboundeth. First day meeting: it was an exercising time, yet ended well, I better.</p></div>
 
<div type="entry" n="1795-02-23"><dateline><date when="1795-02-23">23 the 2 month 1795</date></dateline><p> went to visit a young man who has a desire to come under the care of friends.

<p>I visited a neighbor of mine on a sick bed. She is one that is very unhappy in her temper, and often murmuring at the providences of God, and thinks nobody’s lot so hard as hers. This makes her life unhappy.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-01"><dateline><date when="1795-03-01">1 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Haddonfield meeting first day. This an exercising one. I thought there was such a stir and coughing at times as though they would break up. I found a necessity to get inward, solid, and weighty, so that, if possible, it might be a balance to every light spirit.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-02"><dateline><date when="1795-03-02">2 the 3 month</date></dateline><p> this day engaged in trying to encourage the building, a schoolhouse, in this neighborhood.

He signified the comfort he had in a visit. I paid him some time back. His case was difficultly circumstanced, both inward and outward. I had a feeling for him, but to adminnis [administer?] help was not easy to come at. Far the greatest part was in the bowels of the family between him and wife and her children, for this is a second marriage, and they had suffered the enemy and adversary, the devil, to destroy their peace and happiness, so that their love for each other was lost. As they expressed to me there was great disputing about their temporal entrust, there being money and money’s worth on both sides, the love of which is the root of all evil. There was his and her children by former marriages. Oh that this may be a warning to all those who marry a second time not to lose their affection for each other, and so divide their children, and say “these are my children, and them are thy children,” for this soon begets enmity throughout the whole family, and the loss of that love that is the capstone of all and comfort of parents and children and covers many faults. I wish this may be a warning to all who join in marriage to seek for counsel from the great counselor and everlasting father and prince of peace, and then I believe there will be no mis-marriages, but, being divinely directed, all will be well, and there will be great care and caution in all the conduct and conversation, not to let the tongue run at random, nor say that which might better be spared. This is wrote by one of large opportunity, having been up and down in many places and seen the conduct of many people, as also my own experience, having been twice married,
<pb n="36"/>
the second time to a woman that had children by her former husband. These I dearly love, as I believe she does mine by my first wife, so that we are beloved by them, and her children are my children, and my children are her children, and we love each other. This is to our comfort and happiness.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-04"><dateline><date when="1795-03-04">4 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day visited several sick, as also a widow and fatherless children.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-05"><dateline><date when="1795-03-05">5 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> I have a deep feeling of the changeableness of this world, and how many things there is to embitter this life. The people grow more and more wicked, their hearts are harder and harder one towards each other. Extortion and a worldly spirit seems to run down our streets like a flood. The proud are become honorable, and the wicked are at the helm of government. Oh that we seek a good foundation, for I believe a winnowing time is approaching when we shall be sifted as in a sieve.</p>
<p>This is our meeting and preparative meeting. It was a clost[?] searching time. We answered the queries though hard work, yet I hope, in honesty, I had some hard work to bring it about, for things was very low, and some friends would fain serene themselves, and appear better than they really are.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-06"><dateline><date when="1795-03-06">6 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day spent in clost[?] labor with several who had been long contending about their interest. They had gone far into the law, and spent a great part of what might have settled the matter if being properly applied, but now there seems a more favorable disposition than here to fore. I think I had need be as wise as a serpent and harmless as a dove, for I seem to stand between them both, and things as got very wide amongst them, and very difficult, for it is the estate of a widow in her second marriage.</p>
<p>Now I write this to warn such to have their affairs settled before marriage, as it often causes trouble when left undone till after.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-07"><dateline><date when="1795-03-07">7 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day spent in writing.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-08"><dateline><date when="1795-03-08">8 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at our first day meeting. Low, dull, and exercising.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-09"><dateline><date when="1795-03-09">9 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> our month meeting at this was granted me a certificate to perform a farther visit eastward, as far as the British lines and to Nova Scotia. This was signed by a large number of friends.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-10"><dateline><date when="1795-03-10">10 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this was a favored day. I was engaged in accommodating a very disagreeable difference of a family kind between parents and children. We got it so far settled as to leave it to three men, for they had it in the Court of Chancery for several years at a very great expense, and had caused great uneasiness in the family. This was where was a second marriage. The widow, not first, having settled her affairs and being rich, they contended about their interest, and carried the matter to a shameful hith [height?]. I leave this as a warning to all, not to marry a second time till al their affairs are settled with the first husbands children. This is my advice to widows as well widowers.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-03-11">11 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> least this paper be lost, I take a copy that is as followeth: <TAG>I do hereby acknowledge the gift of a white mare unto Joshua Evans, rising seven years old. As witness, my hand.
This 11 day of 3 month 1795. Charles Newbole. 
And my desire is that my executors, if I should die and leave this mare and Charles, believing that they may return her if she is to be had, and in as good order as may be Joshua Evans.</TAG></p>
<p>I also visited several in tried circumstance. One of which was a young married woman who had been a great libertine, but now, under the preparing hand of the Lord for further service, without a doubt. With me, this was as much as she could bear, for she was got very low, and was calling all in question, and ready to despair the enemy’s temptations. Was many and very clost[?], but it was with me to be a comforter to her, for I did believe the Lord was preparing her for his own work and service. Blessed be his great name, who sometimes sendeth to the hedges and highways of the stones of the streets, raiseth up children unto Abraham. This I believe is her case.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-12"><dateline><date when="1795-03-12">12 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this fifth day meeting. It was but poor, low times. Then met to confer about building a schoolhouse, but could fix no spot to set it, and left it for further consideration.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-13"><dateline><date when="1795-03-13">13 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day continues poor in spirit and heavy laden.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-14"><dateline><date when="1795-03-14">14 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day had some clost[?] labor with one who was a bad man, as was supposed, and had spent much of his time. The Lord had favor him with, and now his head is covered with grey hairs. He took the visit well.</p>
<p>I then visited another family whose troubles has, and still remain, to be very great. This was another second marriage. My labor here was well received, but is a nice matter to meddle between a man and his wife where they have children on both sides.<note type="editorial">The manuscript is unclear here, but if "nice" is the proper reading, Evans likely meant it in the obsolete sense of "requiring tact, care, or discrimination in handling" (<title>Oxford English Dictionary</title>, s.v. "nice", sense 11b)</note> Oh that all that marry may seek for best wisdom, and then I believe they would be safely directed and escape much trouble, but for want of this, many widows have to drink the bitters.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-15"><dateline><date when="1795-03-15">15 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> we had a favored, solid, good meeting. Here I had some clost[?] doctrine. It brought over the meeting a deep solemn pause. This was sensibly felt. This meeting ended well.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-16"><dateline><date when="1795-03-16">16 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had some deep thoughts respecting a future state.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-17"><dateline><date when="1795-03-17">17 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at a meeting at Moorestown, and poor, low one it was.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-18"><dateline><date when="1795-03-18">18 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited one that seemed going as appeared into a consumption. She was a sweet, spirited woman, and seemed much resigned. I was comforted in a belief that all would be well, come life or come death. This is a happy state. Oh, that there was more of the like. It would be a blessing whilst here, and entitle us to a blessing hereafter eternally in the heavens.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-03-19">19 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day began our quarterly meeting of ministers and elders. This was a deeply baptizing day with me. I had to deliver this doctrine, I did believe, that the conduct of some conveyed this language, as to swear they never knew Christ for extortion and hard dealing did so prevail, that rye sold for ten shillings, wheat for fifteen, and things in general in like manner. This is very hard for the poor, but a fine time for the rich to get money, and to increase their treasure, and set their hearts on the things here below.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-20"><dateline><date when="1795-03-20">20 the 3 mo 1795</date></dateline><p> this is the quarterly meeting of business. Here I obtained a certificate to visit the Eastern Governments so far as Nova Scotia. This was a poor, low time, although among friends from distant parts was here.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-21"><dateline><date when="1795-03-21">21 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> for three days I was at the spring meeting. It was an humbling season. The clamor, noise, and crowd that appeared in the city was marvelous to me, although so lately visited with the rod of chastisement. I thought the inhabitants was more wicked than ever, for I was ready to say, “is not the cup of inequity full? Must not they feel thy rod again, dearest Lord God almighty?”</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-24"><dateline><date when="1795-03-24">24 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this a day of deep feeling for the widow and fatherless children and the afflicted everywhere, for many are the trials of the poor.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-25"><dateline><date when="1795-03-25">25 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> my wife and I set out early this morning to go and visit her sister, whose husband was buried about five days ago. This was a great trial to the family, for he was a kind husband, and a tender father, and is a loss to his friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-26"><dateline><date when="1795-03-26">26 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning feel pretty comfortable, though the more part of my sojourning here is in the deeps, and poor in spirit. I visited the old Indians that was somewhat under the care of friends of Haddonfield in the year 1794, and is now at Salem. Friends of that month meeting is about to see what they are in want of, and provide the same and call on friends to defray the expense. This I mentioned, and it was fully united with, and two friends appointed to have the care, and make report to the next meeting. I write this that the next generation may see that some of us loved the natives, and do remember what we have heard our fathers say of the kindness of the Indians to the first settlers. When the Indians was many and the whites but few, and now the whites are many and the Indians few, let us not forget to be kind to them. I was with my wife at our sister Rebecca Collings, where several friends came to see us. We all went to visit these old Indians. I bought ten pound of pork, and she carried a basket full of other things. We went and sat with them in their poor cabin or house, these things was thankfully received by them, the poor old Indians. Let my children always remember, this land was once theirs, and a good living, and, although we bought it, it was at so low a rate, they not knowing the improvements we should make would spoil their hunting as it has done, and reduce them to so great wants. I think we took the advantage of their ignorance, but I see that we, on the ground of strict justice, we are indebted to them, and do not let us forget the royal law of doing to others as we would they should do to us. And then we must, from time to time, help the Indians, and not look at that weakness they are insedent [incident] to, and have unhappily fallen with, to their great disadvantage, of drinking strong drink to excess. Have we not some weaknesses as well? As well as they?</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-27"><dateline><date when="1795-03-27">27 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> I was comfortably with the widow and fatherless children of our brother, David Allen, lately deceased, and much missed in his family, and amongst his friends, he being a man in good esteem amongst his friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-28"><pb n="39"/>
<dateline><date when="1795-03-28">28 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited some friends and went to our son and daughter, Clement and Rebecca Hall, to our comfort.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-29"><dateline><date when="1795-03-29">29 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is their first day meeting. It was a clost[?] trying time, but the doctrine delivered was well received, though, as some said, such as they had never heard, for it was clost[?] home work, and hard to attend to. It ended to my comfort at least.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-30"><dateline><date when="1795-03-30">30 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is Salem month meeting, and an highly favored one. It was both amongst men and women. I took my farewell, as I was going a long journey towards the east country again. In this was many cheeks wet with tears. We parted in great nearness, love, and sweet harmony. Blessed be God, and that forever and ever, saith my very soul.</p>
<p>I also visited a man that seemed as it might be supposed was near his close. I was afraid, unprepared. I had a solid time with him, endeavoring to put him on making a right and suitable preparation. This could not be amiss. Live or die, he took the visit very kind.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-03-31"><dateline><date when="1795-03-31">31 the 3 month 1795</date></dateline><p> came home from Salem under an humbling sense of the Lord’s goodness.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-01"><dateline><date when="1795-04-01">1 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> as is common in my sojourning in this world of changes, cometh wave after wave. I thought this day they would consequently roll over my head, but the Lord may be trusted in, for he leaveth not his truly depending children to fall to the ground. I visited some widows and fatherless children, as is common for those in that station to meet with trials, but they may confide in the promise of Christ Jesus our Lord if they keep their places as becometh their stations. He will be a husband to the widow and a father to the fatherless children. Blessed be the Lord our God and that forevermore.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-02"><dateline><date when="1795-04-02">2 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this was our meeting day. At this time was buried a young man that had stuck a nail in his heel, which was the cause of his and, as was supposed, this was a solid favored meeting. I hope not to be forgot very soon.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-03"><dateline><date when="1795-04-03">3 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited some of my neighbors to our comfort.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-04"><dateline><date when="1795-04-04">4 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was preparing for my eastern journey. I had some awful thoughts on a future state.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-05"><dateline><date when="1795-04-05">5 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is first day meeting. It was a time of favor and a solid good meeting. And in the afternoon visited a woman with a sore breast in much pain, but was somewhat comforted before I left her.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-06"><dateline><date when="1795-04-06">6 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning had some deep thoughts respecting my leaving all that is near and dear to me and of the goodness and mercy of God in my last summer’s visit to New England. This was strengthening to my mind.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-07"><dateline><date when="1795-04-07">7 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> joined some friends this morning in a visit to those that was in the neglect of attending meetings for worship and sleeping when there, and copying after the vain fashions and customs of this world in dress and address. This visit was well received and comfortable to my mind. The opportunities was solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-08"><dateline><date when="1795-04-08">8 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day much in my common way, poor in spirit, and feel lonely and as though I had done nothing for the honor of God. But, as a poor pilgrim and sojourner in a weary land, I sometimes say “why is it so, oh Lord? Am I unworthy the favors that my brethren are favored with, for I hear them say they have good times when my lot is to suffer? But I believe suffering is best form. Let me never murmur for thou sweetens every bitter cup, oh Lord, and art fulfilling thy promise in giving beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and garment of praise, for the spirit of heaviness. Therefore fear not little flock, it is your father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom, ye little ones, and in tribulations ye are my friends.”</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-09"><dateline><date when="1795-04-09">9 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> meeting day. It was a poor low time, as also fore and afternoon.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-10"><dateline><date when="1795-04-10">10 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this night in a dream I thought I saw several Indians that said they lived at a place called Wheel Peeling [?]. These seemed very glad to see me. I thought it appeared as though I must go and pay them a visit if I could find the place. They could not speak English, as I thought, yet there was a feeling nearness.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-15"><dateline><date when="1795-04-15">15 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> now left my wife and children that is near and dear to me, and all for the cause and testimony of truth and the good of souls and peace of my mind.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-17"><dateline><date when="1795-04-17">17 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day rode forty-five miles to Tappan. I was favored with inward calmness which I take as mercy from God to me.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-18"><dateline><date when="1795-04-18">18 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited several families and had a meeting with Friends by themselves at Tappan. Things appeared but low, and the number small, being but one family of friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-19"><dateline><date when="1795-04-19">19 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> first day had a public meeting, which was large.

After noon rode eighteen miles.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-20"><dateline><date when="1795-04-20">20 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Hooke[?] at. This but small. The people appeared solid towards the last, and ended well. We rode the same day nine miles, and had a meeting in the evening at James Cromwell’s. This was large and favored. My mind was brought under an humbling sense of the Lord’s goodness.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-21"><dateline><date when="1795-04-21">21 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day rode twenty miles in a mountainous country up the North River. On the west side, the roads was stony and rough. This was very trying to my poor, weak body so much so as to cause me to bring my close into clost[?] view, but I was favored with a sweet calm and perfect resignation to the divine will. If my day’s work was done, and the Lord would be pleased to accept of me to finish where so ever the Lord may see meet. If I see my dear wife and children not again in this life, blessed, magnified, and forever praised be the great name of the Lord my God, and that forever and ever more saith my soul.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-22"><dateline><date when="1795-04-22">22 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Smith Clove. This was large and laborious. After, we traveled to Cornwell in great poverty of spirit, though as to the outward, things went well. The Lord in time of need was not wanting, though was as an empty vessel from meeting to meeting. Let not the traveler be discouraged.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-23"><dateline><date when="1795-04-23">23 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> I now am at David Sands’ at Cornwell on the west side of the North River. As to my body, I am better, for it has been a trial to my poor body to travel in this rough mountainous country. Had a meeting this day at Cornwell, this not very large and very laborious. The people seemed settled, at ease and lukewarmness in the afternoon of the same day. In the evening, had a meeting at Newburgh. This was very large, and, although interrupted for want of more room, yet a solid favored season, and ended well. I thought truth was over all, and the Lord’s power reigned this in a place where was no friends lived.</p></div>

After some solid conversation with some at a friend’s house, we parted, as I did believe in near feeling love and heartfelt sympathy.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-25"><dateline><date when="1795-04-25">25 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> I feel very poor, having had since left home some baptizing times, but have not lost my faith in God, but feel willing that he may do with me as is best in his work and service, come life or come death, so that I may end well. At last I have at this time a belief, if I should never see home any more, it will be well with me. Therefore, let not my friends weep nor mourn for me. I believe I am where I ought to be, and in the Lord’s work, and service. Blessed be his great and worthy name, saith my soul. This day had a meeting at Mulberry [Marlboro?], large and solid, though, in these parts, the spirit of this world prevails, though the country is new and mountainous and very stony. Here is not a lively sense of truth as I could wish.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-26"><dateline><date when="1795-04-26">26 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Little Esopus. This was large, and the people solid, and it seemed to end well. Afternoon visited four families, some of them appeared tender.</p></div>

This was a good meeting. Then visited two families in the afternoon. These was sweet, tender friends. These families and meetings was in Little Esopus, near eighty or ninety miles up the North River on the west side.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-29"><dateline><date when="1795-04-29">29 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day crossed the North River at a place called Crum Elbow, up from New York eighty or ninety miles. We had a favorable passage. Landed on the east side, and went near Crum Elbow meeting house. Here we lodged with some tender friends. Had on this west side the river eleven meetings. Left these parts to my comfort. Also visited several families.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-04-30"><dateline><date when="1795-04-30">30 the 4 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Crum Elbow. This large and solid. I had some clost[?] labor, which was well received, then visited a sick woman and had a favored time in the family, where I dined respecting the prevailing customs and fashions in eating and drinking and wearing, with a recommendation to moderate labor in bringing up of children, and, as much as may be, to be content with the produce of our own country, and to avoid so free use of tea, for I did believe it impaired the health and made work for the doctors. This seemed better received than what I looked for. This gave me comfort. Blessed be the Lord, his power is over all.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-05-01"><dateline><date when="1795-05-01">1 the 5 month</date></dateline><p> rode to Tideman Hull’s in the these parts. I was well received on both sides of the river, though there is not so lively sense of truth as in some places, yet here is a little few of the tender in heart, and some of these are of the youth. I attended a burial here, though friends, yet I saw something that felt not pleasant, which I mentioned at the place, that was when the corpse was let down in the grave, to cover it with straw before dirt was thrown in. This I could see no use in.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-05-02"><dateline><date when="1795-05-02">2 the 5 month 1795</date></dateline><p> as to my present sense of feeling, it is as is common for me, poor in spirit, but I am thankful, and have no cause to murmur. The Lord has not been wanting in the most needful time. Let all that is within me reverence his great name, who is worthy, worthy saith my soul.</p>
<p>My mind seems to be turned towards the further part of my journey. After attending a few meetings on my way to Lake Champlain, and from thence to Nova Scotia, if way should open and the Lord prosper my goings and enable me to do his work faithfully, for to that I feel myself given up, come life or come death. Had a meeting at Tidemon Hull’s. This was large and solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-05-03"><dateline><date when="1795-05-03">3 the 5 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at the Creek Meeting. This was large, but very exercising.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-05-04">4 the 5 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at their month or preparative meeting. It was a favored time. Truth was over all in this meeting. I was led to revive the necessity of ministers and elders to a deep, watchful care to keep their garments unspotted from the world, as the eyes of the people was towards them as waymarks. That not anything might be a stumbling block in the way of the honest enquirer, as the customs of the world was evil and had gone into many wrong and hurtful things, such as fine houses and rich furniture, fine horses, gay clothing, tea drinking, when we lived in so plentiful a country. These hints was united with by the meeting, and requested to be taken home and observed. Here was many lively remarks made. This meeting ended well and to my comfort.</p></div>

What seemed to open as a spot to take in was that of spending of our precious time in starching and ironing clothes, and to consider the waste of flour in making starch that would feed the poor with bread, and the needless scraps on our garments which was cuffs to coats, high collars about the neck, as also several other needless things that might feed and clothe the poor.</p></div>

<p>This is the quarterly meeting of business. I had much clost[?] labor, which was well received. I believe the meeting ended well. This was at Nine Partners.</p></div>

It is beautifully situated on the river. Here I lodged all night at Elihew Buncor’s. They are building a large brick meeting house here in this town. I visited four families of a friend.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-05-10"><dateline><date when="1795-05-10">10 the 5 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is first day. Had a meeting in the town of Hudson. This was large and solid, and power given[?] to labor for truth's cause in a clost[?] manner. Then parted with friends in near feeling love. They was as kind as any friends need be. Nothing was wanting, least I should be scant of money, John Alsop lent me sixty dollars in gold and silver, which {I gave him an order upon Hannery Drinker, as my friends desired me to do, and they would answer the same to him} I paid at my return. This I took as a great favor.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-06-17">17 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> at this place called Peru, where resided a few friends, about ten families. This morning, we had an opportunity with friends by themselves to begin at the ninth hour, and a public meeting to begin at the eleventh hour. These was large and to our comfort, and there also, for it is not common to be more sensible of the owning of truth then was this day. An aged friend said she had a desire that the states of the people might be spoke to, and this has been done to her satisfaction and so, in near feeling love, we parted with them and traveled twenty five miles and crossed the lake, three miles, to the Grand Isle. Not finding my mind sufficiently qualified to hold a meeting at Plattsburgh at that time, though not, as I thought, clear, and so it proved, though I believe all by divine direction, for the way opened as it could not have done if we had held a meeting then at Plattsburgh, for I believe the Lord’s time is the best time, and we as poor pilgrims ought to not to run before we are called but feel our way.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-18"><dateline><date when="1795-06-18">18 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day our horses gone on to St. John’s under the care of my companion, and we left behind to visit up and down the Lake Champlain. Had two favored meetings, one at the Grand Isle, and the other seven miles distant, at a little town called Plattsburgh. This was a solid, good meeting. And then back to the Grand Isle to log, my soul breathing forth this language, thank thanks to the God and father of all our mercies, who is alone worthy, worthy for way has opened in a marvelous manner, so as no human wisdom could have been sufficient to have done.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-19"><dateline><date when="1795-06-19">19 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had two meetings on the Grand Isle this day. The first the most trying that I been at so great a degree of rawness. Here we had not sat long before one of their great men said he believed the people was all come, and I might go on with what I had to say. He was informed he had better try to be still. That was our custom. I thought he was ashamed, for he got up and went out, and stayed awhile, and then came in and hanged down his head and sat the meeting out very quiet.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-20"><dateline><date when="1795-06-20">20 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting on this isle with the few friends by themselves. It was for conference. This was a favored season. Now being clear of Grand Isle, parted with friends in great nearness and love, I believe not soon to be forgot. Their tears trickled down their cheeks, and they signified their satisfaction. It is all I ask for or crave, that I may be favored to love a good savior, be kind and be so careful to bring no reproach on truth’s cause and testimony. Parted with friends, and went to the Isle of Mott [Isle La Motte?], which is a small isle in the Lake Champlain.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-21"><dateline><date when="1795-06-21">21 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day had two meetings, one on the Isle of Mott, and the other on the mainland. The first a favored one, though small. The last, in the afternoon not so favored, and crossed over the lake to Chazy on the west side the lake, where liveth two families of friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-22"><dateline><date when="1795-06-22">22 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Chazy, large for the place, and a solid, good meeting. Here a man that served as priest desired to know if it would be an offense to sing an hymn. I informed him very calmly that it was not our custom. Then he sat awhile. It was tiresome to that poor things, and so the activity of the creature wanted to be doing something. He stood up and spoke a few texts of scripture, and then sat quiet. I informed them our custom, and the meeting ended to the honor of truth, for it was a solid good meeting.</p>
<p>in the morning, I had an opportunity with the few friends that reside here at Chazy to good satisfaction. We tarried here this night. The women was tried, as they came from old England to settle in this new country. I wish friends not to remove with their families without proper clearness and the advice of the month meeting, and then not let interest be the motive.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-23"><dateline><date when="1795-06-23">23 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> took our leave of friends at Chazy in feeling love, and went by water to Saint John’s, where we had a meeting that afternoon, I believe, to the honor of truth, for there was such a solemnity covered the meeting, that all loose and opposite spirits was bound to the praise of the Lord, be it given.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-24"><dateline><date when="1795-06-24">24 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> several conferences was had by those that wanted to be informed of our principles, and after several opportunities, as they said, to their satisfaction, they gave us some recommendations to some of their friends, supposing it might be to our advantage on our way in Canada. Then we left 
<pb n="45"/>
them, though they said they wanted more of my company, and further information concerning friends and their principles. But I believe we left them well, in an enquiring mind, which will not be lost, I believe, till some fruits is brought forth to the praise of the great husband man, and good of their souls if they continue in faithful obedience to truth’s dictates. And then we travelled to a little town called Tipperary, on the banks of the river Saint Lawrence, a little below the falls. Here I felt my faith almost ready to fail, for such a wicked crew I had not met with since I had left home, and that of a strange language. I now began to call all in question, for I said it was in vain for me to try anymore in this dark popish country. And then laid me down to rest a little, and to renew my strength in the Lord, my helper, who was not wanting in the needful time. We dined, and then went on to an Indian town ten miles up the same river, on the south side, for the river runs at this place east and west, about one mile and half wide. The name of their chief is Captain Thomas, a solid, sensible, sober man, but could not speak English well, but he wanting to be informed of our business. Got an interpreter who read my certificate to him, and informed him of my errand and why I had come so far from home and left my wife and children. He replied it was good, and bid me welcome. He said I was now here, and could speak to him, but should go away and he might forget it, but if I would leave him some writing that he could see some other day, he should take it kind, for he had never heard of us before as a people, and should be glad to be informed of our principles, for he thought strange that their priests would not let them learn to read the Scriptures. He wanted to know my mind. I told him that he was afraid they should see for themselves, and so leave him and seek a better principle than his was, and so pay him no more money. He said he believed so too. I showed him some letters written by some of our Indians. He asked if it was his own handwriting. I told him it was. He said it was good, and appeared very solid. He several lines signified his assent by saying yeah. It was a favored time, and comfort to my drooping mind. Here resided about two or three hundred men, women, and children, in a compact little town made mostly of heaved logs. They seemed to live well. The chief said they raised much wheat and corn. He walked out to show me the town, which was well situated on the bank of the river Saint Lawrence. They appeared a well behaved people, dressed in the Indian dress. Some of them painted in their way, and some with earrings, breast plates, and nose jewels. This was looked on as an ornament. I suppose the chief entertained us well, though in a different way, yet comfortable and freely. His wife a handsome, well behaved woman. She dresses in the common. Was no great distinction in dress between the chief and the rest. They all went without britches, with a short blanket that reached down to the knees. They seem all friendly to each other, and satisfied in their way and manner of living. The name of this town or tribe is Caughnawaga. It consisted of about one hundred and fifty houses.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-25"><dateline><date when="1795-06-25">25 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning, after having written a few lines to leave with the chief, and presenting it to him, which he took kind, and left him some books that I had with me, that he might be informed of friends’ principles. After a comfortable night’s entertainment, took our leave of them, and he bid me welcome and thanked me for my visit, the which I was comforted in finding myself not clear. Returned again to of Tipperary, and, after a little quiet waiting, proposed a public meeting in this town, however strange it might seem, and our landlord offered the privetage of his house, so notice was spread. At three o’clock, about the time appointed, the people met, a considerable number, and the power of the Lord was clearly manifest. The quietness of those rough people was to my admiration, and it was a favored season, though some could not understand English, yet the power was felt to be in dominion over all its enemies.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-26"><pb n="46"/>
<dateline><date when="1795-06-26">26 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning, after having a solid sitting with the family, and another with one Rogers and his family, proceeded on our way towards Montreal. And in our way had to cross a branch of the river, the bridge being gone. Had to drag the wagon on three hewed logs and swim our horses. We got well over and traveled down the riverside about ten miles, then crossed the river Saint Lawrence, and traveled on foot, it being about a mile below the town where we crossed, and left the wagon and horses with my companion, to come when the boat came. As it was gone over, we seemed well received in their way. Here I met with some young men from the Jerseys, one Samuel Newbold. This was pleasant to me, as it gave my wife another opportunity of hearing from me, for he said he would go to my house. I also sent more letters by him.</p>
<p>we took our lodging at a tavern in the town of Montreal, at one Cushing near the market. We had a room by ourselves. These people kept an orderly tavern for them houses, and was kind to us, and their charge not high. We made this our home till we left the town, unless when some that was friendly had us to their houses, as several there were of that number. That felt near to me, and I left this town in love and harmony, and I believe there is room for more labor, and will be somebody’s work another day, for I found a door open in many hearts in the town of Montreal, beyond what I looked for.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-27"><dateline><date when="1795-06-27">27 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at the Presbyterian meeting house in this town in the afternoon. This was very large, as there had never been a friends meeting in this place before, but, they not being acquainted with our way and strangers to silent waiting, soon grew uneasy, and some went away. I had my certificate read. This gave them much satisfaction, as they are stayed a large number, and I believe it ended well, and to the satisfaction of many, for several expressed it themselves, and appeared yet more friendly, even till I came away, and I felt a sense of truth left behind as a little plant or seed, sown for somebody to dress. And I pray the good shepherd may put it into the hearts of some of his servants, messengers, and ambassadors to go to that place with proper authority from the Lord almighty to plead with them to forsake their evil way, and turn to the Lord, for great is the abomination of this country, viz. Canada, for the sacred name is used in common, and few stand clear, even those of the fore rank and old, grey headed men and women, as also much other profane language, and this seems looked on as good breeding or something genteel. These people, an adulterous generation, and much seeped in ignorance by their priests, as they are mostly Romans, and yet I am not without a hope that someday the Lord will have a people in this country, but I think it will not be the work of a day or two, but be advanced gradually and by the Lord’s own almighty power, for human strength is not sufficient. But this day I may not live to see, but shall live in the faith.</p>
<p>{28 of: 6 month 1795} This day being done, and yet not alone, for I believe the dear Lord was with me to my comfort as I was waiting for further opening, and to be divinely instruction from the all wise putter forth. I saw, as it appeared, in the true light, a passage by water, but knew of none to be had, but believed it was right for me to take a walk to the door, and there stood a man, a stranger. He asked me which way I came, and where I was going. I told him I came from near Philadelphia and was going to Dartmouth, if I could, but I had been to the postmaster, who said the way was almost impossible and very trying, either on foot or horseback, and nine hundred and fifty miles. But he thought it much best to go by water. But I knew of no passage. He replied “here was a vessel bound for that place, proposing to sail tomorrow.” This put me to a stand what to say, and more so, as my companion was walked out, 
<pb n="46"/>
[Mispagination: this is the second page labeled “46”]
and where he was, I knew not, but after a little pause I told him it was a favorable opportunity. I was at a loss what to say, but if I knew where the vessel lay, I would go, and see the captain he said if I had a mind to go, and he would go with me to the vessel. I accepted his offer, but when we came, the captain George Searmon[?], was not on board, but, on our return to my lodging, we met him in the street. I informed of the business. He replied he would take us. I, as my companion was gone out, I could not agree fully till he came. I then was informed of those whose employ the vessel was in, and those spoke favorable of the opportunity, and of the captain, but was waiting for an opportunity first with my companion, before I come to a full result. But all was concluded on in the absence of him, but his uniting, and that the other friend, should go back with our horses and carriage. All this was, as I thought, planned. Before I had it, no sooner, came my companion, but he readily united. And then we went and agreed with the captain for five guineas a piece for our passage to Dartmouth, where friends lived. The place unto which he was bound and now ready to sail tomorrow morning. So we proposed in the morning to have our things early on board.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-28"><dateline><date when="1795-06-28">28 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> yearly got our goods on board the ship named Four Brothers, but, in putting off, got aground. That hindered us that day, but we stayed on board, but going by water always was unpleasant, but at this time was more pleasant, for I thought I could freely trust my life in the hand of the Lord, and if this opening was in order for my final close, I saw no other way, and so was willing to submit to his divine disposal and could say “blessed, magnified be his great and glorious name,” though much in the cross to my own will, for I thought I could not submit to go to sea but in summons to the divine will, and so at this time nothing else would have induced me short. And in obedience I go on Lord with an unpleasant company, yet kind to me. Here we lay at anchor all night against Montreal.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-29"><dateline><date when="1795-06-29">29 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the wind freshened up and the passengers all on board. We set sail down the river Saint Lawrence. The passengers was a man and his wife who had engaged the cabin so that the captain himself had turned out till they came to Quebec. This was hard fare to me, but as my mind was favored with an inward quiet, I bore it better than I could have looked for. We got on our way about seventy miles into the Lake St. Peters. This lake is eighteen miles in width and twenty-five in length. Here we came to an anchor that night.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-06-30"><dateline><date when="1795-06-30">30 the 6 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day the wind proved ahead so that we made but little way before we came to anchor again. This night the watchmen fell asleep, and the ship amongst the rock dragged her anchor in great danger, but through favor received no damage, but to our surprise soon struck rock, but soon got off again. The wind ahead, we soon came to anchor again. Here I was led to view the unfaithful watchmen when fallen into a spiritual slumber and the souls of men in danger of shipwreck. We came off better than I looked for. This was cause of humble thankfulness, and made me call my conduct all in question, least I had missed my way, but the way did do open that I did believe it was the Lord’s doings. Come what would of me and knew not how to mend it, though to me, as a man, oh how pleasant would be a prison
<pb n="47"/>
compared with this, but I found to look forward would not do, but to make the best of all, come what would, and leave the event to the Lord to do as is best in his light, so that all might be to his honor, and the creature abased and more and more brought low, and laid as in the dust. The prospect of being so long we conjoined (viz. for two or three weeks) my pen cannot set forth the depth of my mind and bitterness thereof. At times, though to me kind, was the captain, except at times his language I could not speak well of. This caused me to look every way and try every concern, I could not find, but the honor of the cause of truth and good of souls was what I had in view, therefore I hoped I had not offended the God of all good.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-01"><dateline><date when="1795-07-01">1 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> laid most of this day at anchor, though sometimes drove with the current. This made it seem tedious, but to be as much retired as I could be of sound would be best, for the winds and the seas was only at the command of the Lord, and we must submit to his divine disposal. Sometimes things felt pleasant, but not always so, for I found hard to the natural part, but this I leave for those that may come after, that they may trust in the Lord alone, for though our captain was an active man and did well attend to his business, yet I could place but little confidence there, but it was for all to my comfort when he was on board, and so far well.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-02"><dateline><date when="1795-07-02">2 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> laid at anchor the most of this day. The wind was much against us, but at night drove with the current within nine miles of Quebec. This appears to be a flat, level country, and thickly settled, though the houses poor and the inhabitants mostly French and can speak but little English. This was some addition to my trials, to be amongst a people of a strange language, but I strove to make the best of every cross occurrence, and let not my faith fail in the Lord, if he would please to keep my head above water and my soul from sinking. I thought I must look for a long passage of one month.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-03"><dateline><date when="1795-07-03">3 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning a fresh breeze. We soon came broadside of the town of Quebec. This town is near two hundred miles from Montreal, on the north side of the river Saint Lawrence. It stands on a mountain and point of land near half round. This consists of the lower and upper town. The lower near the water under the hill, with one street and then an ascent in some places more and some less from one to two hundred feet, so upright that it is not passable for man or beast through this. There is a passway up the hill as by nature. The upper town is large, the buildings good, and seems very compact, but not so large as I looked for not more than one third near as large as Philadelphia. Here our captain and sailors went on shore, and the sailors got too much strong drink. This made them quarrelsome. The captain, being not onboard, and that was not the worst, for I could not tell how soon they would murder each other, for they struck with clubs and handspikes, but I told my companion after some little trial, “it might be best to stay in the cabin and let them alone,” but this was such a trial as I think never met with before, and no way to flee for refuge but to the Lord, who faileth not them that can put their trust in him. I strove after an inward quiet, as it was likely this would be such a night as I had never passed, but through divine favor the captain came on board. This gave me some relief, for he bore much sway. Things seemed in some measure to settle, but to set forth my exercise I think I cannot but must leave my reader to judge of things, as I had at best a thousand miles at best yet to go.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-04"><dateline><date when="1795-07-04">4 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> about eight or nine this morning weighed anchor. There being not much wind, made not much headway. The country on both sides. The rivers very thick, settled. Their farms being laid out in lots from fifty to one hundred rods in width. The land mostly pretty level. Their buildings looked well and comfortable.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-05"><dateline><date when="1795-07-05">5 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the wind blew more fresh. I began to be unwell with the motion of the ship, but no way to flee but to him that regardeth the sparrows. Blessed, magnified be his great and glorious name saith my soul.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-06"><pb n="48"/>
<dateline><date when="1795-07-06">6 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this and the seventh we passed on one side a very mountainous, unsettled country, and on the other side out of sight of land, as the river grew very wide. We had come about three hundred and fifty miles from Quebec to a place called the Gulf of St. Lawrence, or Cape Rosier. Here we soon left sight of land. The wind blew fresh and my sickness increased insomuch that I thought the sea must be my grave for my shattered constitution, as I thought I could bear but little more. I was not able to sit up, and the motion of the ship so great at times that I could hardly keep my bed, which was none of the best. It was some sails, though the captain gave me a mattress. This continued for two hundred miles and near three days before we came in sight of land again. For fear of the ship coming on shore, the captain thought best to stand out to sea that night. This put us ten or twelve leagues out of our course, the wind blowing fresh and looked stormy. Oh! the exercise of my soul and prayers to God that he would be pleased not to leave me in this trying season, who failed me not, for I felt him to be a stay and a staff to lean upon in the most greatest trials of all. Here I was led to look more clostly[?] into my stepping along and the cause of my being here, and on the most clostest[?] inspection, I could say it was in obedience to the divine will, and the best that I new [knew] how, come life or come death, I could submit and commit myself to the Lord with a well grounded hope and faith that it would be well with my soul, and all felt clear and easy, and the sea, if it must be my grave, was now no terror. I found Jerusalem to be a quiet habitation. Because of my inward retiredness, they thought I was low spirited. I told them it was not so, but I wanted to be still and quiet, but felt a good degree of calm and resignation. Blessed be the Lord our God, to whom my prayer was day and night, whose attentive ear was open to hear the cries of the poor.</p>
<p>This continued till the eleventh, and there we came in sight of the lone end of the isle of St. John’s, the sight of which was pleasant to me, a poor pilgrim, for I was wary of the seas, but the Lord’s goodness was so great that my desire was, and is, that it may never be forgot by me, so long as I have a being here on earth.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-12"><dateline><date when="1795-07-12">12 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> Here we lay after a hard gale, and in danger of rocks and shales between the island of Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, for we had the mainland on the one side, and Cape Breton on the other side. This morning was calm. This was rather a comfort to my body, but about noon the wind freshened up. We entered the Gut of Canso with an uncommon time of favor, which I ascribe to him who can command the seas and the winds, and they obey him, for we passed this place in safety, such as made the captain confess it was of the Lord’s doings. No sooner had we passed this danger, but a calm ensued that lasted till night, for we passed this gut, so called because of its narrowness between the mainland and Cape Breton. This passage saves three or four hundred miles. It is about twenty miles in length and about one mile in width. A deep awful sense of the Lord’s goodness, lovingkindness, and mercy impressed my mind. The wind soon abated and became calm. Here we lay all night near Cape Canso.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-13"><dateline><date when="1795-07-13">13 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning was a thick fog that we knew not where we was, nor how far from land. This to me was very trying, but no way but to look to the Lord and be still, who was pleased to arise to my comfort and disperse the thick fog. The sun appeared, and we not out of sight of land, but the wind freshened against us, but the captain, as well as we, anxious to see the desired port in order to pass a point of land, stood out to sea till about noon, and then turned towards land again. The wind blew fresh and contrary. My sickness increased and, for fear of the land in the evening, out to sea again. The wind against us. My pen cannot describe the exercise of my mind, but I felt my mind stayed on the sure foundation and blessed cornerstone Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be ascribed all praise, dominion, and honor.
<pb n="49"/>
From the thirteenth to the sixteenth we had but little wind, and that contrary. The vessel rolled to and fro. This increased my trial, for none can think how wary I of my situation and the tossing of the vessel in this situation. We continued to the sixteenth about noon, and then the Lord was pleased to favor us with a fresh breeze. This I can but ascribe to his divine goodness, as several other times of the like favors when my faith was ready to sail and my head to sink.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-16"><dateline><date when="1795-07-16">16 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> about noon the wind blew fresh, but not fair, but so that we came pretty well on our way. It continued all night, and in the morning we was in sight of the bay goeth up to Halifax. This did look pleasant, but not knowing how soon we might be far from it again, as the captain said. He when so near had been drove three days out to sea again.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-17"><dateline><date when="1795-07-17">17 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> our hopes increased of being favored to arrive at the so long desired port, which was granted about the middle of the afternoon. We arrived at Dartmouth, to my great comfort, where we was kindly received by our friend Seth Coleman. I thought all within me gave way and reverenced God my savior, to whom be all ascribed, saith my soul. I was reduced very low in body, but my spirits somewhat revived under an humbling sense of the Lord’s goodness, loving, kind, and mercies, whose favors has been great to me while on the water.</p></div>

Here we was kindly entertained.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-20"><dateline><date when="1795-07-20">20 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning visited three families to good satisfaction, for I believe, as they said, we came in the right time, for their trials was very great, and their minds unsettled, for friends had mostly gone and left them parts. Those that remains are but a little few, and they could not see their way clear to go away. This was a sore trial to these, to whom I was a comfort, as they said, and had come at a time when most needed.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-21"><dateline><date when="1795-07-21">21 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day visited six families who appeared solid, and some tenderness. They was good countenanced. This town of Dartmouth handsomely laid out in lots intended for a town. Here is between fifty and a hundred houses on the east side of Jabucta[?] Bay, and, on the other side, the town of Halifax, consisting of about five hundred houses on the west side the bay, compactly built and strongly fortified, the sight of which a burden to my mind. The sound of war was too frequent. This made my stay here not so pleasant, although the kindness of friends was not wanted.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-22"><dateline><date when="1795-07-22">22 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> my mind hath its usual exercise, but nothing more than common for me.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-23"><dateline><date when="1795-07-23">23 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day we was at three meetings: a meeting for public worship, and one by way of conference, and then adjourned till three in the afternoon. This was called a preparative, in which their church affairs was transacted, and marriages allowed. By reason of their remote condition, these was as solid favored meetings as I was ever at, so far as I was capable of judging for the place. They was large and comfortable to me, their business well conducted, and I saw no room for them to be discouraged because of the smallness of their number, for I did believe divine kindness was near to them.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-24"><dateline><date when="1795-07-24">24 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day feel poor in spirit, and so it is often my lot. Did a little writing {and visited one family.} We went to visit the ship crew that we came with, who was glad to see us. Here we had some disagreeable accounts at Boston, New York, and Philadelphia of mobbing and rioting, and a prospect of wars between Britain and America. This was to me heartfelt pain – for the very sound of wars and the roaring of cannons I am wary of.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-25"><dateline><date when="1795-07-25">25 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> wrote two letters to my wife and children.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-07-27">27 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day took our leave of Dartmouth. Many friends and others came to take their leave of us. We had a solid parting. The soldiers, having got the ferry boat for their service, we went up the bay and then swam our horses over the bay. It being near half a mile, we got well over, and that day rode upwards of thirty miles. I had a severe lax, so that we stopped at a public house. The next day was rainy, and I very unwell, so that we tarried here. The twenty eight, they was very kind and tender to me. My mind was much humbled, but was favored with an inward quiet. Blessed be the Lord.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-29"><dateline><date when="1795-07-29">29 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning a little refreshed. Set forward not without some difficulty. Rode near forty miles to another public house by the name of Peck. I felt much spent. We was bound for Samuel Moore’s towards Annapolis, a friend. Oh, the trial of body and of mind! It is hard for me to express. The people showed much kindness. The country thick, settled, and the road good. The country most mountainous, but the people seemed to live in plenty and great openness to receive friends, for they was wary of their teachers.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-07-30"><dateline><date when="1795-07-30">30 the 7 month 1795</date></dateline><p> being very unfit to travel, we hired a chair for me to ride in, for we had forty miles or more to travel this day and I, remaining weak, for my disorder continues. We reached Samuel Moore's that day, it being one hundred and seven miles. Oh the comfort it was to my poor tried body and mind!</p>
<p>Here we tarried till the third of the eight month. Had two meetings, one in his house, large and favored, and another on the mountain nearby. These parts being thick settled and the minds of the people open towards friends, I had to marvel at the kindness of all sorts and all ranks of people. They interceded for us to stay longer and have more meeting, for they thought it a favor our coming amongst them.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-04"><dateline><date when="1795-08-04">4 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> being somewhat recovered, we set forward toward Annapolis and had a meeting this afternoon at Randolph. Very satisfactory, though a rainy time. It was large. I, a little recover as to my health. We appointed two meetings next day, one in a Baptist meeting house nearby and another about ten miles. Of these was favored here appears great openness amongst the people towards friends. They are very kind to us.</p>
<p>These two last meeting was held the fourth of the eighth meeting. This was trying to my weak body, but enjoy a degree of divine favor. Blessed be the Lord who has been near in the most trying time of all. Blessed, magnified, and forever praised be his great and glorious name, oh Lord God almighty, saith my soul.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-06"><dateline><date when="1795-08-06">6 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day travelled on to Annapolis and so to Edward Thorn’s, about nine miles from Digby, who was so kind as to take his boat and go with us to Digby without fee or reward. This is a little town of about one hundred houses standing on the bay, or basin so called, it being at the mouth of Annapolis River where it emptieth through a narrow passage into the Bay of Fundy, about one mile wide and three in length. Here the tide riseth and falls thirty feet. This night lodged at a tavern in this town.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-07"><dateline><date when="1795-08-07">7 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day had a meeting in Digby town in this tavern in a large room. This was offered freely. I was not free to hold one in their steeple house. This was large and favored, and they expressed a heart tendering season. To some they said they wished we would stay longer and have more meetings, but, the vessel being near ready to sail in which we was to go in to cross the Bay of Fundy to New Brunswick at shore, we went onboard and was on the water all night. And a trying night it was to me,
<pb n="51"/>
though not stormy, yet I was very sick with the motion of the vessel, as was several others that was passengers. We had on board a bishop of the Church of England, so called. He showed great respect to me, and was desirous to see my certificate, and when he had read it he much commended it, as also the order, and said it well agreed with his sentiment. After this, it seemed to increase his love to me, and would often come and say, “Friend Evans, how do you do? Are you any better?” and, when we parted, in his way gave me his blessing, as did a great many others same. I had reason to believe was sincere, for it was with tears trickling down their cheeks in great tenderness, and I feeling love, for many are as sheep without a shepherd through these parts, and if any friend find their mind’s turned this way, here is a great field of labor, and much openness at this time towards friends as I ever saw in any of my travels: the country well settled, the people remarkable kind, the roads good. On the other side the Bay of Fundy there was nothing that oppressed my mind with weight but the manner in which they came by the land, the inhabitants being taken from their lands and good farms, well improved, and another come and possess their labors, for I saw good farms, and many of them that was taken from the French and given to them. This was contrary to my mind, insomuch that I could but leave them my sentiments respecting the injustice, and told them was I so situated I should hold myself indebted to them so long as I held it from them, and would show all kindness to them whenever I could, that it might be some retaliation. They said they thought it was very wrong, so to take their lands and give it to another as had been done, but saw no way to help it, for they was drove from their homes, and the king had settled them here. To me it appears a very trying situation, as also the great preparation for war.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-08"><dateline><date when="1795-08-08">8 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> after a passage of about twenty-two hours. This was a favorable passage, it being about {near fif} forty miles from Digby to New Brunswick, where we landed in the afternoon. Was kindly received by the friendly people. As many of them had been educated amongst friends, and had a love for them, but was as sheep scattered having no shepherd.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-09"><dateline><date when="1795-08-09">9 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day had two large and favored meetings at New Brunswick on the Bay of Fundy. I believe to the honor of the cause of truth and tendering of many hearts, for many expressed their satisfaction, and they had not for a long time heard such gospel truths declared. The solid sitting of the people was to my admiration, as a long silence was held at the fore part of the meeting, and many of them never had been at a friends meeting before, but this was the Lord’s doings, no doubt with me. Blessed be the name of the Lord for his manifold mercies towards me. As I say sometimes, I am as a worm and no man.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-10"><dateline><date when="1795-08-10">10 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day am waiting at New Brunswick for an opportunity to go on to Beaver Harbor, the boat being not quite ready. Visited a few families and was writing pretty quiet in mind, being kindly entertained, the people wishing us to stay longer and have more meetings, for many expressed their satisfaction in the meetings we had in this place, for it had been long since they had heard the gospel so preached.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-11"><dateline><date when="1795-08-11">11 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> yearly this morning went onboard the boat with four oars. The weather being favorable, we got to Dipper Harbor, about twenty miles, when we tarried all night at one French’s who entertained us very well and would take no pay. We had for our company Samuel Moore and Jesse Woodard, whose company was very pleasant.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-12"><dateline><date when="1795-08-12">12 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning went on board again, it being about halfway to Beaver Harbor. We had a favored passage by water. This was trying to me. We reached the harbor about noon, and then appointed a meeting at five this afternoon. the number was small, but a solid, favored time. We was well received by Joshua Knight {another meeting tomorrow}.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-08-16">16 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had two large, favored meetings at Machias to general satisfaction. Here was not one friend but ourselves, nor never had been a meeting held before. The people sat solid and quiet, and many of them expressed their satisfaction and wished us to stay longer, but it was not agreeable to {our} my minds, for I often think when things are left well, it is best to make no additions, nor long or unprofitable delays, but to leave them hungering after more meetings. This I write for the instruction of my fellow travellers {that} so we may leave a good favor, and not become burdensome in our visits, and in a special manner amongst strangers, for in some places we had need be well assured we have good authority for what we do, least we hurt the cause of truth, and wound ourselves, and suffer the activity of the creator to be set to work, and we miss our way, and take imagination for revelation, but, to I, the putting forth of the great and good shepherd who puteth not his own[?] forth, but that he goes before them and prepares the way.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-17"><dateline><date when="1795-08-17">17 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the people was very kind, and many gave us invitations to partake with them while we stayed, and lent us two horses to go on our way twenty miles to Pleasant River towards Pornopscot [Penobscot?], and a man to fetch the horses back, and would take no pay, but I gave the man at our parting a dollar for his kindness, for he seemed to do it with so good a will that I was not willing to omit giving something.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-18"><dateline><date when="1795-08-18">18 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Pleasant River, not large, though solid, and in most of these places a great openness to receive friends. It looked as if the fields was white unto harvest and much room for labor, for many are weary of their preachers and their minds. Looking and wishing to become more acquainted with friends, I have believed the Lord would send more of his servants into this place. Oh that they may be as wise as serpents and harmless as doves. After meeting, we crossed the river to Richard Coffin’s.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-19"><dateline><date when="1795-08-19">19 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day hired two horses and a man to fetch them back at a dear rate, but as we had no horses of our own here, we must do as we could so that we could get along. We traveled upwards of thirty miles to Frenchman Bay in the province of Maine. Here we lodged.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-20"><dateline><date when="1795-08-20">20 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> here the man, it being rainy, went back with the horses after traveling six or seven miles to Paul Dudley Seargon’s[?], who offered us his boat and hands to go with us near thirty miles. But, it being rainy, we tarried all day in this place. He offering freely to entertain us. He appears to be a very kind man.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-21"><dateline><date when="1795-08-21">21 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning went on board the boat. Went down Frenchman Bay and so by water to Blue Hill, so called, it being on our way towards Penobscot. We had a pleasant passage. I had to admire the goodness of the Lord in preparing our way. Blessed be his great and matchless name, saith my soul, tremblingly and in great awfulness and true love and fear. Let it ever remain under an humbling sense of his many mercies.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-22"><dateline><date when="1795-08-22">22 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> yearly this morning, hired two horses, crossed a neck of land six miles, and then by water again to Penobscot. Here I felt very poor, and the way seemed closed up as to the outward, but, lying down to take a little rest, word came that an opportunity presented to go ten miles in a boat by water across the bay. This so far struck my mind that we agreed for our passage, and put our things on board, but feeling myself not clear, and may unexpectedly opening for a meeting the next day, and trust the Lord to make way as he had done here to fore.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-08-23"><dateline><date when="1795-08-23">23 the 8 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had two meetings at Penobscot. It was thought large, solid, good meetings.

Riding on horseback was trying to me, an old shattered constitution, but am favored. Blessed be the Lord, to whom is all due, and nothing to man nor the contrivance of men, for {to} all is nothing that we can do. This I have been clearly convinced of in this, my pilgrimage or journey, for the honor of God and good of souls. Oh that it may have the desired effect! I was well and kindly received by all the people, and many of them gave me their blessings, in their way. Some sincere, some of form.</p></div>

The first a solid, good meeting. The last large and interrupted by the peoples going out and coming in, which is often the case when friends hold meetings in them kind of houses. To me, there appears a need of care how we too freely make use of their houses, though offered by them. These two meetings was held in {the} Cohorse.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-07"><dateline><date when="1795-09-07">7 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting in Sharon near Jared Bassett’s, {and about noon set out towards Danby.} This was large, but not so favored, I thought, by reason of a friend saying too much, and dwelling too long on giving an account of his exercise and convincement. This brought such a death over my mind that I was ready to say I shall never open my mouth in public anymore. I have thought as little as may be. Is best on that score, for I have often been wounded to hear friends in their public testimonies enlarge too much in this spot. Set out about noon toward Danby.</p></div>

This was where had never been a friends meeting held before, and, although unacquainted with our practice and way of meeting, sat commendable still, and appeared very solid. It was large and a favored season. We was kindly invited to several of their houses, but it is my belief when we are clear, the sooner they are left in the hand of the Lord to do with them, as is best in his sight.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-13"><dateline><date when="1795-09-13">13 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the towering height of the mountains in this place to me appears awful. They, being more so than I ever have seen before. They are up to the clouds, and there is much more rain and snow than in the more level parts of the country. Some think twice as much. Oh how hard do some of these live that settle these new countries where they are so rough and mountainous. I went to visit some of those who in their little cottages covered with bark, as is most of their houses, or thatched with straw. This tendered my heart. Was at first day meeting at Danby, large and exercising, though power was given to labor for truth’s cause, and the spreading thereof. Many things opened in my view, some of which was the free use of rum, tea, and tobacco. These things I believed was never introduced by the dictates of truth, but came in as a thief in the night at the backdoor, and standeth behind the curtain, and is too much out of sight, for custom has blinded our eyes, as it has in many other evils, to the great hurt of us as a people, but I have faith to believe the Lord’s work is on the whole, and will go on, let who will oppose it, but it will not be the work of a day or two, but most go slowly on as way opens, for I believe it is the Lord’s will to bring about a reformation, and that the work is be gone. Let the faith of none of the little ones fail them, for I believe those that are first called to this work will have to go through great exercise, but their reward standeth sure blessed be God.</p></div>

He seemed very tender at parting, and gave me his blessing, and wished the Lord might prosper the work in my hands.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-20"><dateline><date when="1795-09-20">20 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Pittstown first day meeting in their new meeting house, the first held in that house, and the largest gathering they had seen. A solid, favored season it was. To see how solid and commendable the people sat in all the meeting was marvelous to me, though of all ranks and of all sorts it was evident that truth reigned over all and in dominion.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-21"><dateline><date when="1795-09-21">21 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> rode from Pittstown to Albany, and so to Coeymans Patent.</p></div>

Here I had some clost[?] labor, respecting the work of reformation and the necessity of entering thereon, as things was much out of order here, and friends at ease and lukewarm and thinking growing of a wrong nature fast, and none to say nay.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-24"><dateline><date when="1795-09-24">24 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is month meeting at Coeymans Patent. It was a laborious time, but power was given to labor for the cause of truth, and, after the business was ended, men and women sat together and had a solid opportunity on the work of reformation, and contracting of our wants, and leaving off wholly rum, tea, and tobacco, and to have less to do with foreign trade, for its channel was so corrupt and caused so much confusion and bloodshed, and to bring up our children in a course of industry, and as the harmless cow came with a fresh supply of milk twice in every day, morning and evening, pray let us be content with homespun fair.</p></div>

This was a favored season. Some said they hoped the Lord would bless and prosper my labors. The people behaved solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-27"><dateline><date when="1795-09-27">27 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> in the forenoon had a meeting at New Britain, large and solid, and in the afternoon another meeting at Stephentown, large and laborious, but power was given to labor for the honor of God and his most holy cause and good of souls. This day I am sixty four years of age, and this summer have been on a religious visit through Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, and York yearly meeting, and at times am truly humbled under a sense of the Lord’s goodness in preparing the way before me, which I am clear no man could have done so well, for I wanted for nothing that could be had, for great was the kindness of the people.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-28"><dateline><date when="1795-09-28">28 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning visited a settlement of the people called Shakers. They received us friendly, but very reserved. I informed them that I felt my self drown forth in love to come and see them, and if they was free to come and sit down with us, and if anything arose on their minds or ours, to mention to do it freely, without being cramped, for as I had never seen any of that people, but had often heard of them, as he said, no doubt but some false and some true. Then leaving us to go and consult the brethren. Then, returning, asked if I was born in this country. I said yes. Then, what was my profession? I told him I was one of the people called Quakers, and had a certificated, and was willing to let him see it, which I did. After reading it, asked if I was free, he should show it to some more of them in the next room.
<pb n="56"/>
I told him I was willing to, as many as he pleased. He then went into the next room, where was several came by. This time to consider the matter, for I find they move as a body, and are much united as one family, and do not act without consulting together. Here they read my certificate, as I could hear them over and over. This took some time, and then he returned and gave me my certificate again, and said they found I was a member of that society, and was an approved minister, and was going a long journey. But I informed him I had been, and was now on my return, and if he was free to inform me of their custom, principles, and manner of worship, I should be willing to hear it. He said they believed in Christ Jesus, and in his second appearance, and did endeavor to live up to the scriptures and to become the followers of Christ, being members of his church by being baptized with the holy ghost, and coming under the cross that had crucified every fleshly lust. This he seemed very confident in, and that they now had no desire after women more than a child. I said “be not too confident. Has thou felt not anything towards women at no time?” He confessed that he had been tempted, but had power to resist the tempter, and that they had forbid to marry, and held it not right, and that in marrying and so doing, all the world was wrong and laid in sin but themselves. I asked if he thought there was none went to heaven in all the world but that little few that was of them. I told him I traveled a great deal, and found, of all societies, some tender spirited little ones that I did believe was in favor with God. Said I, “Dost not thou believe so?” He said “yeah.” “Do not you come short at some times?” He said “Yea, but are restored again. But the manner with which you gratify yourselves with your wives when you do not believe they are in a capacity to conceive or bear children, and that, from the gratification of this, lust proceedeth all fornication and adultery, and not for procreation or to multiply, but to fulfill the lust of flesh, for which cause we forbid to marry, and do take up the cause against these lustful desires. Therefore, believe we are right and all others are wrong.” I told him that if those that married erred on one hand, they did so on the other in forbidding that which Christ did not, for that a man should leave father and mother and cleave to his wife. Although I did see they was in error, there was something in his remark worthy serious thought, so that none abuse that of marriage in gratifying themselves and fulfilling their lustful desires when no intention of multiplying or populating their country, in my thought, deserves our serious thought, I believe they, poor things, look too much this way, and are in an error, I fear. Yet when I see so much sin committed amongst men and women, it is no marvel with me that some should be raised up that should forbid to have anything to do with women, and forbid to marry. Though believe a path, as I told him, between us both, near or right, that was to marry and not go in unto her but for propagation. “Dost not thou believe so?” He said “yea.”</p>
<p>I asked him respecting their manner of worship. He said they came together every night, and took a solemn pose, and had some labor in the manner of their worship. I asked in what manner, and if they had anyone that was looked upon as their minister. He said nay, but they began after this manner when they was come together, if any of the elders felt anything, to arise with weight on their minds, they was at liberty to speak, and then began with singing of Solomon’s songs and so to dancing,
<pb n="57"/>
and so continued to the end. I told him it was not our custom so to do, but to meet together, and sit down in silence, believing that the time now is when God is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and that this may be acceptably performed where no vocal voice is heard, but in solemn, awful, reverent silence. To this he made me no answer.</p>
<p>He said they owned George Fox, and believe he was a good man till he mixed with the world, but that he then fell away, and that there had been a falling away until now, and that we had lost our gift of discerning, and had many defected rotten members in our church, and therefore could not be the church of Christ.</p>
<p>But that they had that gift amongst them and had sought out some of the most deep, hidden sins, and had brought them to make open confession, I told him I was afraid they was mistaken, and that they was not so whole as they thought they was. He appeared to me to be solid, sober man, and well behaved. He said they lived in love, and all as one family, and each one their portion of labor according to their ability, as they had many sorts of mechanics or tradesmen, and some to have the oversight and see that their work was well done, and that nobody should be wronged or deceived, and passed the inspectors before sold. This gained them credit amongst those they dealt with, and their words was to be depended upon in their trade and dealings so that those that bought nails by the barrel did not find one that was not fit to drive. They was so careful that a friend told me he went to buy half a bushel of onions and could not get them till they had passed the inspector.</p>
<p>He told me that they did not receive members if they had wronged anybody until they had returned fourfold, and that when they came amongst the, they put all they had into the general stock, and if at any time they thought best to leave them, they took as much as they brought, and no more. Although there is some errors amongst them, such as I could not unite with, and some unguarded members that gives them a bad name, some of such I saw that bridled not their tongue, but the one that confer with us was a sensible, solid, moderate man, and went very deep into some things, and, after a space of three or four hours conference, he kindly invited us to stay and dine, said our horses was eating good hay, and they would soon have dinner. I told him we thought it kind, but believed best to go. He said he was not afraid to confer with me, for I was not on my critics, and we parted in love, and I thought better of them than before. All about them looked decent and clean as an industrious people.</p>
<p>The women are much by themselves. Their business was spinning, sowing, knitting, and weaving, and managing the other household affairs.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-09-29">29 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at East Hoosick. Very large, as almost all the meetings are. This was held nearly in silence, but solid. The people sat quiet and orderly, for the which I gave them the praise and requested they would not be discouraged, but come to meeting again, for we believed God might be worshiped where no vocal voice was heard, and that the hour cometh, and now is that. As God is a spirit, we all profess what we may. Must worship in spirit and in truth. After noon visited several sick, for it is a time that many died.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-30"><dateline><date when="1795-09-30">30 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited several families of whom Robert Nesbit was one. He being very low in this place, had some satisfaction in laboring for truth.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-01"><dateline><date when="1795-10-01">1 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at the preparative meeting at East Hoosick. Very large. In the fore part, favored, and, as it was a time when they read and answered the queries, I sat first with the women in their part while they answered the queries, who went as deep into a search of things as I ever saw friends go, to my comfort. After they had done, I then sat with the men as they read and answered the queries, and a poor low time it was amongst the men in their part. The life and power was wanting, and fear of coming too clost[?], and so answered evasively, to my grief, for I did fear the queries was likely to become as near to them, for they sought their own ease and not the honor of truth.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-02"><dateline><date when="1795-10-02">2 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> rode to Eanes Curtis’ in company with several friends. I was grieved to see this man making so large preparation for making cider.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-03"><dateline><date when="1795-10-03">3 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Curtis’ house. This was small, dull, and poor and, to me, mournful. Afternoon went on our way towards Tyringham and, in our way, visited a Shaker settlement. Had a solid conference and then was permitted to see the women who appeared plain and sober. One of them, an ancient one, spoke freely and friendly. Asked several questions which I answered so far to her satisfaction that she asked if I would not come and see them again. I thought there was something of instruction in their appearance. Their dress was moderate, their head clothes in one uniform manner so that their appearance moderation as though they as they said lived much in cross, but as to this I feared they was not so fully acquainted with as I had wish they did. I may say I had some satisfaction in this my visit to them.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-04"><dateline><date when="1795-10-04">4 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Tyringham. A large, solid, good meeting, and ended well, after which had some solid conference in company with the committees from East Hoosick month meeting, respecting the continuance of a meeting in this place, as the number is but small, and things but low, and needs the care of friends, as I thought.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-05"><dateline><date when="1795-10-05">5 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> traveled to Goshen. A very rough road. This country is rough and mountainous. To Charles Richards’, a singular man in almost all his conduct, but an honest hearted man that felt near to me, and with whom my soul did unite in almost all his ideas, for I think he went deep into things, and had the cause of truth at heart.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-06"><dateline><date when="1795-10-06">6 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Goshen in Charles Richards’ house, large and solid, though the people are in these parts long at coming together.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-07"><dateline><date when="1795-10-07">7 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at the Branch, so called, in the afternoon. Dull and heavy.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-08"><dateline><date when="1795-10-08">8 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at small and, in the fore part, a poor low time till came in some of other societies, though gay in clothes, yet I did believe the Lord had regained to them, for power was given to labor, which I felt not before, but a dull, drowsy, indifferent, lukewarm spirit, and at the close I felt a desire to have another meeting with the inhabitants. The next day I signified the same, which was united with, and a place appointed, and they the gay sort proposed to have the care of spreading the notice. This was their preparative meeting at this place. Things appeared very low.</p></div>

<dateline><date when="1795-10-09">9 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting near the town of New Milford in a private house with those not friends. Very large, and a time not soon to be forgot. It was a solid favored meeting.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-10"><dateline><date when="1795-10-10">10 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at the Valley at friends meeting house. Large and solid.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-11"><dateline><date when="1795-10-11">11 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting at Peach Pond. Small, poor, and exercising. I had some labor.</p></div>

The life and power was wanting. The world and things thereof took the room of the heart. Oh the crowding cares of this world, cleave to me! Choked the good seed. The members became dry and barren and withering. I had some clost[?] labor that seemed well taken.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-13"><dateline><date when="1795-10-13">13 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at the select meeting in this place. Exercising, poor, and dull.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-15"><dateline><date when="1795-10-15">15 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> here I met a committee on the boarding school at Nine Partners. Here I was led to signify my prospect respecting a boarding school. This was a solid time, and I was led more than ever deep into the nature of the education of dear little children. This my mind I left with them to consider of as I believed it my duty.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-16"><dateline><date when="1795-10-16">16 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at the month meeting at the Creek. It was very exercising, poor time.</p></div>

The young people sat solid, more to my comfort than when the parents was with them. This was sorrowful to think of, but so it was the unlawful use of lawful things is the greatest snare the enemy has to catch friends with in this snare. He hath caught many of our society, to my grief, as I pass up and down in this land.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-18"><dateline><date when="1795-10-18">18 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> I was at a meeting at Little Nine Partners. Large, laborious, and exercising. The house much crowded and held not all the people. Power was given to labor for truth, to the tendering of some. Blessed be the God of all good, whose power is not lessened, nor hand shortened.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-19"><dateline><date when="1795-10-19">19 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting with youth at Nine Partners. This was very large and a solid, favored time, to the tendering of many hearts, a number of whom was of the rebellious naughty ones. Oh that it may not soon be forgot by them, but be as bread cast on the water to be found after many days, to the healing of the wounded in heart, and sitting for eternal life, peace, and happiness! After this, proposed a meeting tomorrow with parents.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-20"><dateline><date when="1795-10-20">20 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had a meeting with parents and heads of families at Nine Partners for the month meeting. This large and a solid, good meeting. Here I revived some of the sense of friends in yearly times, respecting fine houses and rich furniture and a worldly spirit that is very prevalent in this place. Also the free use of cider tea and {smoking} tobacco, all which I did believe might be well spared, for, as there was many friends that had to bear their testimony against these things to their dying day, is a conformation to my mind. The free use of these things was not the dictates of truth, but came in as a thief in the night, and that the Lord will still raise up them that must bear testimony for God and the maintaining of his most holy cause and truth on earth against these things till a reformation is brought about amongst friends.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-21"><dateline><date when="1795-10-21">21 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> had another meeting at the Creek or stone house with heads of families. This was also large and a favored time, as many said, and I was of the same mind. Here I had to revive some of the sense of our ancient worthies, now in their silent graves, but their memory lives and is fresh in some minds to this day. Their punctuality in their dealing and at a ward and that they was trusted, without being bound by the law, to be just and true in all their dealings. Their words was looked on as good, as their bonds here I also had to revive as before the evil use of cider, tea, and tobacco, as also the weighty care of the education of children and the ruinous effects of a neglect.

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-25"><dateline><date when="1795-10-25">25 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Purchase first day meeting. Very large, so that the house could not contain them all by many, but it was the most wicked set. If I was favored with a truesome of their states that I have met with since I have left home, yet they sat commendably well for so mixed a multitude, but I believe myself not clear of this meeting. I was led to lay things clost[?]. I was so bowed that I hardly could hold up my head all that afternoon. I believe that meeting is but a poor place. I thought the faithful was but few in number.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-10-26"><dateline><date when="1795-10-26">26 the 10 month 1795</date></dateline><p> travelled to Oblong in order to be at that quarterly meeting. This country is rough and mountainous, the roads bad. This day a friend who was educated a Presbyterian said he was convinced by hearing some little children saying thee to one another; they seemed so lamb-like, he said, it was truth’s language. Now see, dear friends, what plainness will do, though in little children, and how much more in parents and heads of families, when we live up to our first principles, then are we not stumbling blocks to the honest enquirer, but as good way marks, and as the salt of the earth, having not lost its savor, so it will be felt for miles round where this is a neighborhood.</p></div>

This was near the close of the mortality in that town, after what might have been an humbling time, and have weaned the people from the eager pursuit of earthly riches, and to have sought that which is more durable, and should last beyond time, but so soon as the rod was stayed, to my grief, the inhabitants turned again, as the sow, to the wallowing place and so waxed worse and worse.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-23"><dateline><date when="1795-11-23">23 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day visited a few families and had some contest with an old formalist Quaker who had been long in trading, and now pleads for it as the richest and only way to improve a new country and enable people to live happy. This was greatly to my astonishment, but I found the god of this world had blinded his eyes, but as I told him, to my grief, while we was dealing with and disowning the youth for going out of plainness, such things as they was selling them was the very things that they was dealt with for wearing this. I said before him, but I found him blind and deaf as an adder, for he would not hear, least it should clash with his worldly entrust, for I thought it was his god though an high professor. Those things I laid clost[?] as he could bear, and so left him. This was in New York.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-24"><dateline><date when="1795-11-24">24 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> left New York about the eighth hour in the morning and traveled forty miles towards home.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-25"><dateline><date when="1795-11-25">25 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> continues my way homeward. Forty more the next day.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-26"><dateline><date when="1795-11-26">26 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> reached home this evening after a long and trying journey of four thousand miles, and near eight months time. With cause of deep humble thankfulness to the God and father of all our mercies who has prepared the way before me, let me never forget his goodness so long as I live in this world. The reward is sufficient for all my labor. How trying it was to my weak constitution. The Lord kept me from sinking below hope in the most trying time, when tossing on the sea and sick almost unto death, yet was favored with an inward stay and staff to lean upon.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-27"><dateline><date when="1795-11-27">27 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> for two days after my return, finding my wife and children alive and grandchildren, except one infant that was deceased, this was cause of humble thankfulness, it being more than I expected from what I had heard of the sickness and mortality in that neighborhood, for many have been called from time, both aged and youth, and that in a few months. Husbands from wife and wife from husband, parents from children and children from parents, that there was no age exempt.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-11-29"><dateline><date when="1795-11-29">29 the 11 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this was first day meeting at Newtown, this place where I belong, and a favored one. It was an heartfelt joy once more to meet again.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-01"><dateline><date when="1795-12-01">1 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited several families. One of them was Isaac Mickel and wife, she being in a poor way, though innocent, as I thought, and calm.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-03"><dateline><date when="1795-12-03">3 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this our preparative meeting. It was an exercising time. Hard labor for the poor servants of the lord who cannot hold their peace but must speak to the people.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-04"><dateline><date when="1795-12-04">4 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited some sick {and had some smith work done at my wagon}.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-05"><dateline><date when="1795-12-05">5 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this was the beginning of our quarterly meeting, the select part. It was a clost[?] searching time. I had to mention in this meeting several superfluities, and in particularly large looking glasses, as being one cause of so much pride, and the unfitness of the heart and mind to go to meeting after standing before the large glasses and putting all their clothes in print, and the heart filled with pride. I thought it high time to reduce the number of those large glasses and put them all away.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-06"><dateline><date when="1795-12-06">6 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is our first day meeting. This a favored time.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-07"><dateline><date when="1795-12-07">7 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the quarterly meeting business now began. It was my lot, as is often, to blow a trumpet where the enemy is making his advance, as all the answers to the queries mentioned that of a drowsy spirit in meetings. I told them I believed it was in part owing to living too high and luxuriously, and eating too freely, and using spirituous liquors such as cider and wine in too plentiful a manner, and smoking tobacco. These things drains of the juices, and dries up the sweet fluids of the body, and so dulls the spirits, and unfits it for divine service. This was my belief. Was one cause amongst a many others that caused so much drowsiness in meetings.</p>
<p>In this meeting was revived a concern for the Indians, as they was once the owners of this country, and we had bought it at an under rate, as they did not consider the value, nor know how we should, by living amongst them, destroy their hunting by clearing the land, but, as I feared, the prospect of friends at this time was turned towards the foreign Indians, which I had no objection to, but at the same time, not let us forget those on whose land we not live, for they are in want that are in our neighborhoods, but visit those and see if these are not in want immediately, as winter is coming on. I also mentioned what was my thoughts as I traveled through many parts of this land, when I beheld the hills and valleys that, as I thought, was once covered with their flocks and herds, and much game, and easily taken, such as beasts of the field and birds of the air, and now we, the white people, had killed and drove them away, and cleared the land, and spoiled their hunting, and made their living hard, and covered the country with ours that was of another sort. This appeared clear to me to called for our sympathy and tender feeling, for the natives, the Indians, and that we do not let them suffer for want of food nor raiment. I also thought was a suitable time to discharge the little trust the Lord had reposed in me in pleading the dearest[?] cause. I told friends not to buy their baskets and brooms and pay them with cider or strong drink, as they had a weakness that way, and would sell their things for less than the value for strong drink. Neither pay them in old clothes, but buy them such as was strong and new, and give them full the worth of what they bought. I hoped that no friend would be cross to the Indians, although the land was now much improved and cleared, not to refuse to let them build their houses or cabins on their ground if they should want, for they must be somewhere, and as timber was become scarce and dear that we speak calmly and peaceably to them, and let them know that as timber is now scarce, they must endeavor to make the best of it, and when they cut a stick to make the best of it, and work it all that is fit for use, but not to refuse them that liberty. And when we cut a tree that may suit them, cut off a piece for them. This, I believe, would prevent their wasting the timber giving uneasy, and preserve and brighten the chain of friendship that was between our fathers and their fathers at the first settling of this land, for they lived in great friendship since. My memory, which is about sixty years ago, for, then, there was many Indians, and we lived as brothers, for they was kind to us, and we to them. This makes me love Indians, for I cannot forget it.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-08"><pb n="66"/>
<dateline><date when="1795-12-08">8 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this and the 9th visited several sick and infirm, to my and their comfort.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-10"><dateline><date when="1795-12-10">10 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was our weekday meeting. It was a solid, good meeting.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-11"><dateline><date when="1795-12-11">11 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Evesham month meeting in company with several public friends. Here was much said, some of which might have been spared if I had a true sense of the matter, for I have often thought that a few words and that to the purpose, is better than a great many. When the life and power is wanting, and it is, my sense and judgment that our meeting for business ought to be for that purpose, and that public friends, if anything, to say by way of ministry, to be as short as may be, so as to discharge the trust reposed in them, and be clear, for we have many public meetings, and preaching is not wanting, but life and power.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-12"><dateline><date when="1795-12-12">12 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day in feeling sympathy, I felt my mind turned towards the poor and afflicted. First I visited an aged friend that seemed as though his time was nearly run out, and the day’s work not done, as I feared, I urged him to use all diligence. The little space of time was yet behind, for he said he thought every hour would be the last. I asked if this did not alarm him. He said yes. I told him it was an awful thing, of brought so near as that death and judgment was the next thing to be entered on.</p>
<p>I then visited a widow and her afflicted daughter that had married an unworthy husband. They appeared much in the innocency and, I did believe, in favor with God, both the mother and the daughter. They was rejoiced to see a friend that could sympathize with them. Oh that none may join in marriage without divine counsel and to direct! And then I believe there would but few so unequally yoked and unhappily married as now. There is too many for want of this.</p>
<p>I then visited some old Indians in old age and suffering condition, with whom I had tender sense of feeling, for I did believe the comforts of life was wanting. Their bedding laid on the wet ground and was no more but a little straw, their clothes scanty, and cabin poor. I thought it was likely they often wanted for a little comfortable nourishment. As one of them was between eighty and ninety, and her daughter upwards of sixty, and she blind. These, both widow and consequently not able to support themselves, I did believe this case called for friends care and speedy help.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-13"><dateline><date when="1795-12-13">13 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Haddonfield first day meeting, and poor time it was. I thought they had got into a lukewarm state. Although of late they had been visited with sickness and death, many of the inhabitants numbered to their silent graves, and several now in a languishing condition, yet great insensibility and forgetfulness of God, and a worldly spirit prevailing to the grief of my mind. Oh, death! Death who is the king of terrors! What a favor it will be for them that, when thou come, are found so ready that they may say “Welcome, welcome oh Lord, thy servant is ready,” and that state attained to that the grave may look pleasant, and it be no terror.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-14"><dateline><date when="1795-12-14">14 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is our month meeting. We had the company of several friends from a distance. There was several things came before the meeting: that of distilled spirits. This was sharply spoke to by several, who thought that to make a free use of cider and wine, it would have a tendency to weaken the cause, and their own hands hang down, and friends not to keep spirits in their houses, but, as formerly, in apothecary’s shops only, for there was a fire in some that the use of cider and wine increased. However, there was a committee appointed to have the care in that case, and make report, but I had a belief the cause was flattening, and friends grew weaker and the world gained the ascendency and preference in the hearts of almost all, a little few excepted who has not bowed to Baal nor kissed his image. 
<pb n="67"/>
And further was recommended the mind of the yearly meeting respecting the Indians that lived in the wilderness, from whom the white people had taken their land, and destroyed their hunting, and have drove them so far that now it is hard for them to live by hunting, and now they wish to learn to be farmers, and to be instructed in husbandry, and have schools, and learn to read and write so that they may read the scriptures and be instructed in our principles. This I did write with, as I was of the belief we was much indebted to them, and more so to those on whose land we do reside, that are in straightening circumstances, and hard beset for the necessities of life, a number of which are far advanced in life. To these my mind was most towards, and wished that a few friends might be appointed to visit them and inspect their circumstances, and afford them immediate relief, if need. This was united with, and a committee appointed, and entered on our minutes. This I told them would be a credit to the next generation to see our kindness to the Indians.</p></div>

Gave them some advice respecting religion and living a sober, religious life, so that when death comes, they may be ready, and go well and be forever happy. This I laid clostly[?] before them, as the most material work we had to be engaged in the little stay we have here. They appeared solid. Some of this was near parting.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-17"><dateline><date when="1795-12-17">17 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is our weekday meeting. Friends brought more than common of the youth to this meeting. I had a hope of an increase of living, faith, life, and power revived.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-18"><dateline><date when="1795-12-18">18 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> nothing remarkable. Feel some bodily affliction.</p></div> 

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-19"><dateline><date when="1795-12-19">19 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> for five days visited a number of the afflicted, who seemed rejoiced. We was made thankful in the Lord’s goodness and each other’s company, though, at times, feel great poverty of spirit and heaviness of mind, yet a little faith remains.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-24"><dateline><date when="1795-12-24">24 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Pilesgrove month meeting. A most trying time it was. I thought I must now give out, for it seemed as if the floods would swallow me up, and everything looked gloomy, and the worst of all, I was afraid the Lord was angry with me, and was about to hide his face from me. I said, “Oh Lord, suffer me not to fall a prey to the enemy of my soul. Though wave cometh after wave, I know help is in thee.”</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-25/1795-12-26"><dateline><date from="1795-12-25" to="1795-12-26">25 and 26 of 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> visited some in deep affliction of body, but I believe in favor with God, for I did believe he was full filling his promise, who said he would be a husband to the widow, and a father to the fatherless children. Here I had some increase of strength.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-27"><dateline><date when="1795-12-27">27 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Salem first day meeting. I had some clost[?] doctrine. It seemed well received, but a friend, standing up, who had a smooth way of speaking, {but I not being not used to handle the polishing rust for,} yet I believe time calls for plain doctrine. In the afternoon with the black people at the same place. Here was a large number. It was somewhat favored, but poor me was yet low and poor in spirit.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-28"><dateline><date when="1795-12-28">28 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Salem month meeting. In this meeting my bow was renewed in my hand, and I had some faithful labor, both in men’s and women’s part, to my and their comfort. I was led to set forth the pernicious effects of a worldly spirit, and a departure from that ancient practice of friends being at a word in their dealings, and the bad effects of a sumptuous way of living, also that of building fine houses with rich furniture, and, in a particular manner, large looking glasses as being the very enjoins of Satan, and I did believe pride would not have had so rapid a growth if there had been none of them amongst friends, and that we remember the faithful testimony of our ancient worthies against the free use of rum, tea, and tobacco.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-29/1795-12-30"><dateline><date from="1795-12-29" to="1795-12-30">29 and 30 of 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> returned home and, in my way, visited several sick, to our joy in each other.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1796-01-01"><dateline><date when="1796-01-01">1 the 1 month 1796</date></dateline><p> for six days was in and about home, and did but very little good, for, instead of attending with the committee on the Indian affairs, I let in the reasoner and thought myself of so little consequence it was not best for me to go, and so was good for nothing, losing that time. This I leave as a warning for others that may be so tried.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1796-01-08"><dateline><date when="1796-01-08">8 the 1 month 1796</date></dateline><p> I had it on my mind to attend a neighboring month meeting, but the enemy of all good was busy again, and tried to turn me aside anyway. So, as to answer his end, for it matters not the way, so the end is answered and the Lord’s work not done. I lingered and lingered till it was almost out of season, till every joint trembled and I said “let me not fall at last by the hand of Saul!” I cannot describe my distress, but none knew my state but the Lord alone, but in great weakness I was favored with a little strength so as to press through all, and when I came there, my bow was renewed in my hand, and a favored time it was, both in men’s and women’s meeting, for my mind was turned to the women’s part, where I had to speak to parents and children respecting a worldly spirit, and going into superfluities in dress and furniture, this I had to press in plain language, for I believe there is too much of smooth work, for the times for plain dealing is much wanting, but who is willing to stand as at the north gate in the Lord’s watch and blow the trumpet at the approach of the enemy, though clost[?] work was called, for the meeting ended well.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1796-01-09"><dateline><date when="1796-01-09">9 the 1 month 1796</date></dateline><p> I went and attended another month meeting and had much the same service for my Lord and master blessed be his great name who is eternally worthy of all adoration and praise for he is a rich rewarder of all them who serve him faithfully</p></div>

<p>also I spread before the meeting a fear that for some time had attended my mind on account of a school being set up in Haddonfield to encourage the youth and others to learn the French language here I thought I saw a danger and snare laid for the feet of the dear youth and that it opened a door for popularity and would be like to lead in to unprofitably mixing with persons of loose conduct and bad principles this this seemed to fret some of the promoters for they supposed to have been highly applauded but there was many both young and old that united with me and was glad that it was mentioned in so public a place for I did believe that 
<pb n="69"/>
those that did go into it should consider well the grounds of their movement and take friends’ advice previous thereunto for I believe this to be more of that worldly spirit now if we could be favored to teach our children humility and self-denial this perhaps with a blessing might prove of lasting advantage when time to us shall be no more here this time loudly calls for when it is evident the judgments of the Lord is in this land for often is the sound of mortality in our ears and the cry of the widow and fatherless children and yet the people’s hearts remain hard oh how many of late have been taken parents from children and children and some in a short warning oh that all may be concerned to be ready when death comes for then ready or not we must go and leave all to another state of being that is never to have an end</p></div>

<p>after this visited an ancient friend as also two women that was in a poor state of health one of which diseased in two days after I visited a Methodist family who appeared religiously disposed they was very tender and expressed satisfaction</p></div>

A cure for fellins. Take lime and soft soap, mix it together something thinner than mortar, put it into a brass thimble, and bind it on. Keep it on till all the black stuff runs out, which may be six or eight hours.
It has been an effectual cure by some that have tried it.
