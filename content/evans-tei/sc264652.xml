The above Friends were visited by our esteemed Joshua Evans from the 17th PM to the 23rd AM of the 7 mo. 1794 accompanied by his Friends Deborah Davis Caleb Green Thomas Rotch and Charity Rotch. Through the several sittings in said families, the ownings of divine favor was in a good degree evidenced, friends were in general mostly solid in attending to the cautious counsel and invitations to endeavor to come out of the several deep rooted customs so prevalent amongst us, to the hindrance and obstructing the work of reformation and regeneration and by preventing any fourth progress or introduction of those things which tend to leaven the mind into the customs and fashions of the world, not only to prevent but to put away such as may be removed out of sight. That our women Friends whose province it is to order the house may get together endeavor to unite consider and confer on the important subject what may be {do} necessary to be done in order as effectually as may be to remove those things and to strengthen each other’s hands to encourage the youth in the paths and piety and virtue, that the next generation may be such as may be instrumental in advancing the cause and testimony of truth in the world, which must be by way of the cross

The above named Families (most all of them belonging to no religious society were visited by our beloved Friend Joshua Evans from the morning of the 11th to the evening of the 12th of the 8 mo. 1794 accompanied by his companion and us. A good degree of weight and solemnity attended most of the families and the encouraging communications counsel and advices (of our esteemed Friend were kindly received (to the tendering of many hearts) which was not to seek the law at the priest’s lips, but turn the mind inward to the teachings of free grace given to all etc. Through the several sittings the ownings of divine favor was in a good degree evidenced, we believe to the edification and comfort of many honest enquirers of which there seems to be a considerable number here and having so freely united with him in spirit according to our measures that we feel desirous to give a testimony thereof—

<floatingText>Beloved Friend
I having it on my mind several weeks past to visit thy wife and children, and little flock at Newtown meeting, and now write this at thy house after meeting, the 29th of the 6 mo. 1794 The meeting (thy wife says was smaller than common) and much like many others now a days. close hard labor fore part before we can get through an indolent spirit which too much prevails. however I hope it ended well at last.
Thy dear wife expressed a gladness as we were riding together to meeting alone, and said it seemed a little like having thee with her. Abraham’s letter will inform further concerning her and the children. The accounts I have heard from thee have been very satisfactory and tends much to the confirmation of my mind in the belief that thou art in thy proper place. I often think of thee, and sometimes am almost ready to wish I was with thee, if I dare; however I have often thought it would have been very pleasant to me if way had opened for it, or that it had been so ordered, and I desire to be remembered by thee—friends here have divers times enquired after thee but I have not seen thy letter and have heard but little though that little has been very comfortable and gives encouragement to hope that thou will be preserved and helped along, and as far as I can discover it would be very acceptable to all thy friends to have thee return (when thou art clear though it were with thy beard on; for I think it is more plain to be discovered amongst thy friends now than ever, that thou hast left something like a sweet smell and a delectable savor which may be looked upon as a great favor, to be so far preserved, and now in a fair way I hope to fill up thy days work in the day time so as to receive the answer of well done at last; is the desire of thy friend whose love and regard time nor distance has not diminished in the least.

Much Beloved Friend					Epping 10 mo. 20th 1794
	Although I {h}am in some measure sensible of my unfitness to salute thee in any way that may be satisfactory yet thought it would yield me some satisfaction in this unexpected event of thy going out of these parts without seeing thee again for indeed I did not think so much about a final parting but what I held a secret thought of seeing thee again and now could I see that it could be with consistency I should propose meeting thee at Pittsfield tomorrow but as things now are I can’t see how I can break out {and} through them but must submit to my allotment and deserved probation to think of thy going out of our parts so soon before we grow 
any better is an addiction to my discouragements for if every leaning stock is removed and the staff also taken away how shall poor I ever pattern after a Joshua so as effectually to take up the resolution of serving the Lord. but thus much I believe if no more thy company will do convince us whereabouts we are and what we might have been had we been more like thee in coming up in faithfulness to what has been discovered by the same spirit and less like unfaithful Saul who made exceptions of things called to be destroyed, and for others who have not who have not so grossly offended as I fear I have it doubtless will help them on their way so that I rejoice thou hast trod the wearisome path of sojourning amongst us and believe thou has not labored in vain and now in a measure of that love that filled my heart towards thee at my first being in thy company which was, a larger portion than I could expect to have enjoyed do I affectionately bid thee farewell wishing to be remembered by thee as a poor child if thou can find me deserving of it in the least

<div type="entry" n="1795-01-28"><dateline><date when="1795-01-28">28 the 1 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day I find an act made for regulating Indian affairs</p><quote><p>that from and after the publication of this act if any person or persons within this colony shall give or sell to any Indian or Indians any strong liquors whereby they become intoxicated or more than one quart of beer or cider or half a gill of rum or any other spirit in one day to any one Indian except there be apparent necessity for so doing he she or they so doing shall forfeit and pay for each time the sum of twenty shillings and that if any sale be made by any Indian within the colony and any part of the consideration be paid in strong liquors more than by this act is allowed to be sold to such Indian the sale of such goods is hereby declared void and the property not altered hereby and that every pledge or pawn given by any Indian for drink shall upon complaint be delivered up to him by order of any one Justice of the peace</p>
<p>3 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid that every debt which shall be contracted by any Indian for strong drink shall be esteemed null and void</p></quote>

<p>but has not gadding abroad and tea drinking with their formal visits been the ruin of as many and set them as far of the favor of God and wasted their living in folly and vanity and by their custom done in more to their hurt for idolatry is as bad if not worse than drunkenness</p>
<p>I think it has been as great a grief to my mind the free uses of tea and coffee as ever it was when I was among the drunkards for I thought they were as great to the stranger simplicity of the truth and as far from God as the greatest drunkard that I saw when they was handing it about the rum on their servers when I have seen this I have been ready as one did in a similar case to say hear oh heavens {and give ear} and be astonished oh earth at the extravagancy of the people when every poor cottage must have its tea ware oh the expense the country is at for tea ware and its attendance and the excess that it has got to that many conclude that they cannot live without it no more than the drunkard can without rum only behold the cups and saucers they drink it out of what are they do not they witness against the tea drinker and all its attendance with this language abominable idolatry accompanied with that pride that is offensive in the sight of the most high</p>

them though they said they wanted more of my company and further information concerning friends and their principles but I believe we left them well in an enquiring mind which will not be lost I believe till some fruits is brought forth to the praise of the great husband man and good of their souls if they continue in faithful obedience to truth’s dictates and then we travelled to a little town called Tipperary on the banks of the river Saint Lawrence a little below the falls here I felt my faith almost ready to fail for such a wicked crew I had not met with since I had left home and that of a strange language I now began to call all in question for I said it was in vain for me to try anymore in this dark popish country and then laid me down to rest a little and to renew my strength in the Lord my helper who was not wanting in the needful time we dined and then went on to an Indian town ten miles up the same river on the south side for the river runs at this place east and west about one mile and half wide the name of their chief is Captain Thomas a solid sensible sober man but could not speak English well but he wanting to be informed of our business got an interpreter who read my certificate to him and informed him of my errand and why I had come so far from home and left my wife and children he replied it was good and bid me welcome he said I was now here and could speak to him but should go away and he might forget it but if I would leave him some writing that he could see some other day he should take it kind for he had never heard of us before as a people and should be glad to be informed of our principles for he thought strange that their priests would not let them learn to read the Scriptures he wanted to know my mind I told him that he was afraid they should see for themselves and so leave him and seek a better principle than his was and so pay him no more money he said he believed so too I showed him some letters written by some of our Indians he asked if it was his own handwriting I told him it was he said it was good and appeared very solid he several lines signified his assent by saying yeah it was a favored time and comfort to my drooping mind here resided about two or three hundred men women and children in a compact little town made mostly of heaved logs they seemed to live well the chief said they raised much wheat and corn he walked out to show me the town which was well situated on the bank of the river Saint Lawrence they appeared a well behaved people dressed in the Indian dress some of them painted in their way and some with earrings breast plates and nose jewels this was looked on as an ornament I suppose the chief entertained us well though in a different way yet comfortable and freely his wife a handsome well behaved woman she dresses in the common was no great distinction in dress between the chief and the rest they all went without britches with a short blanket that reached down to the knees they seem all friendly to each other and satisfied in their way and manner of living the name of this town or tribe is Caughnawaga it consisted of about one hundred and fifty houses</p></div>

<p>we took our lodging at a tavern in the town of Montreal at one Cushing near the market we had a room by ourselves these people kept an orderly tavern for them houses and was kind to us and their charge not high we made this our home till we left the town unless when some that was friendly had us to their houses as several there were of that number that felt near to me and I left this town in love and harmony and I believe there is room for more labor and will be somebody’s work another day for I found a door open in many hearts in the town of Montreal beyond what I looked for</p></div>

Canada for the sacred name is used in common and few stand clear even those of the fore rank and old grey headed men and women as also much other profane language and this seems looked on as good breeding or something genteel these people an adulterous generation and much seeped in ignorance by their priests as they are mostly Romans and yet I am not without a hope that someday the Lord will have a people in this country but I think it will not be the work of a day or two but be advanced gradually and by the Lord’s own almighty power for human strength is not sufficient but this day I may not live to see but shall live in the faith</p>
<p>{28 of: 6 month 1795} this day being done and yet not alone for I believe the dear Lord was with me to my comfort as I was waiting for further opening and to be divinely instruction from the all wise putter forth I saw as it appeared in the true light a passage by water but knew of none to be had but believed it was right for me to take a walk to the door and there stood a man a stranger he asked me which way I came and where I was going I told him I came from near Philadelphia and was going to Dartmouth if I could but I had been to the postmaster who said the way was almost impossible and very trying either on foot or horseback and nine hundred and fifty miles but he thought it much best to go by water but I knew of no passage he replied here was a vessel bound for that place proposing to sail tomorrow this put me to a stand what to say and more so as my companion was walked out

and where he was I knew not but after a little pause I told him it was a favorable opportunity I was at a loss what to say but if I knew where the vessel lay I would go and see the captain he said if I had a mind to go and he would go with me to the vessel I accepted his offer but when we came the captain George Searmon[?] was not on board but on our return to my lodging we met him in the street I informed of the business he replied he would take us I as my companion was gone out I could not agree fully till he came I then was informed of those whose employ the vessel was in and those spoke favorable of the opportunity and of the captain but was waiting for an opportunity first with my companion before I come to a full result but all was concluded on in the absence of him but his uniting and that the other friend should go back with our horses and carriage all this was as I thought planned before I had it no sooner came my companion but he readily united and then we went and agreed with the captain for five guineas a piece for our passage to Dartmouth where friends lived the place unto which he was bound and now ready to sail tomorrow morning so we proposed in the morning to have our things early on board</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-09-28"><dateline><date when="1795-09-28">28 the 9 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this morning visited a settlement of the people called Shakers they received us friendly but very reserved I informed them that I felt my self drown forth in love to come and see them and if they was free to come and sit down with us and if anything arose on their minds or ours to mention to do it freely without being cramped for as I had never seen any of that people but had often heard of them as he said no doubt but some false and some true then leaving us to go and consult the brethren then returning asked if I was born in this country I said yes then what was my profession I told him I was one of the people called Quakers and had a certificated and was willing to let him see it which I did after reading it asked if I was free he should show it to some more of them in the next room
<pb n="56"/>
I told him I was willing to as many as he pleased he then went into the next room where was several came by this time to consider the matter for I find they move as a body and are much united as one family and do not act without consulting together here they read my certificate as I could hear them over and over this took some time and then he returned and gave me my certificate again and said they found I was a member of that society and was an approved minister and was going a long journey but I informed him I had been and was now on my return and if he was free to inform me of their custom principles and manner of worship I should be willing to hear it he said they believed in Christ Jesus and in his second appearance and did endeavor to live up to the scriptures and to become the followers of Christ being members of his church by being baptized with the holy ghost and coming under the cross that had crucified every fleshly lust this he seemed very confident in and that they now had no desire after women more than a child I said be not too confident has thou felt not anything towards women at no time he confessed that he had been tempted but had power to resist the tempter and that they had forbid to marry and held it not right and that in marrying and so doing all the world was wrong and laid in sin but themselves I asked if he thought there was none went to heaven in all the world but that little few that was of them I told him I traveled a great deal and found of all societies some tender spirited little ones that I did believe was in favor with God said I dost not thou believe so he said yeah do not you come short at some times he said yea but are restored again but the manner with which you gratify yourselves with your wives when you do not believe they are in a capacity to conceive or bear children and that from the gratification of this lust proceedeth all fornication and adultery and not for procreation or to multiply but to fulfill the lust of flesh for which cause we forbid to marry and do take up the cause against these lustful desires therefore believe we are right and all others are wrong I told him that if those that married erred on one hand they did so on the other in forbidding that which Christ did not for that a man should leave father and mother and cleave to his wife although I did see they was in error there was something in his remark worthy serious thought so that none abuse that of marriage in gratifying themselves and fulfilling their lustful desires when no intention of multiplying or populating their country in my thought deserves our serious thought I believe they poor things look too much this way and are in an error I fear yet when I see so much sin committed amongst men and women it is no marvel with me that some should be raised up that should forbid to have anything to do with women and forbid to marry though believe a path as I told him between us both near or right that was to marry and not go in unto her but for propagation dost not thou believe so he said yea</p>
<p>I asked him respecting their manner of worship he said they came together every night and took a solemn pose and had some labor in the manner of their worship I asked in what manner and if they had anyone that was looked upon as their minister he said nay but they began after this manner when they was come together if any of the elders felt anything to arise with weight on their minds they was at liberty to speak and then began with singing of Solomon’s songs and so to dancing
<pb n="57"/>
and so continued to the end I told him it was not our custom so to do but to meet together and sit down in silence believing that the time now is when God is to be worshipped in spirit and in truth and that this may be acceptably performed where no vocal voice is heard but in solemn awful reverent silence to this he made me no answer</p>
<p>he said they owned George Fox and believe he was a good man till he mixed with the world but that he then fell away and that there had been a falling away until now and that we had lost our gift of discerning and had many defected rotten members in our church and therefore could not be the church of Christ</p>
<p>but that they had that gift amongst them and had sought out some of the most deep hidden sins and had brought them to make open confession I told him I was afraid they was mistaken and that they was not so whole as they thought they was he appeared to me to be solid sober man and well behaved he said they lived in love and all as one family and each one their portion of labor according to their ability as they had many sorts of mechanics or tradesmen and some to have the oversight and see that their work was well done and that nobody should be wronged or deceived and passed the inspectors before sold this gained them credit amongst those they dealt with and their words was to be depended upon in their trade and dealings so that those that bought nails by the barrel did not find one that was not fit to drive they was so careful that a friend told me he went to buy half a bushel of onions and could not get them till they had passed the inspector</p>
<p>he told me that they did not receive members if they had wronged anybody until they had returned fourfold and that when they came amongst the they put all they had into the general stock and if at any time they thought best to leave them they took as much as they brought and no more although there is some errors amongst them such as I could not unite with and some unguarded members that gives them a bad name some of such I saw that bridled not their tongue but the one that confer with us was a sensible solid moderate man and went very deep into some things and after a space of three or four hours conference he kindly invited us to stay and dine said our horses was eating good hay and they would soon have dinner I told him we thought it kind but believed best to go he said he was not afraid to confer with me for I was not on my critics and we parted in love and I thought better of them than before all about them looked decent and clean as an industrious people</p>
<p>the women are much by themselves their business was spinning sowing knitting and weaving and managing the other household affairs</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-07"><dateline><date when="1795-12-07">7 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> the quarterly meeting business now began it was my lot as is often to blow a trumpet where the enemy is making his advance as all the answers to the queries mentioned that of a drowsy spirit in meetings I told them I believed it was in part owing to living too high and luxuriously and eating too freely and using spirituous liquors such as cider and wine in too plentiful a manner and smoking tobacco these things drains of the juices and dries up the sweet fluids of the body and so dulls the spirits and unfits it for divine service this was my belief was one cause amongst a many others that caused so much drowsiness in meetings</p>
<p>in this meeting was revived a concern for the Indians as they was once the owners of this country and we had bought it at an under rate as they did not consider the value nor know how we should by living amongst them destroy their hunting by clearing the land but as I feared the prospect of friends at this time was turned towards the foreign Indians which I had no objection to but at the same time not let us forget those on whose land we not live for they are in want that are in our neighborhoods but visit those and see if these are not in want immediately as winter is coming on I also mentioned what was my thoughts as I traveled through many parts of this land when I beheld the hills and valleys that as I thought was once covered with their flocks and herds and much game and easily taken such as beasts of the field and birds of the air and now we the white people had killed and drove them away and cleared the land and spoiled their hunting and made their living hard and covered the country with ours that was of another sort this appeared clear to me to called for our sympathy and tender feeling for the natives the Indians and that we do not let them suffer for want of food nor raiment I also thought was a suitable time to discharge the little trust the Lord had reposed in me in pleading the dearest[?] cause I told friends not to buy their baskets and brooms and pay them with cider or strong drink as they had a weakness that way and would sell their things for less than the value for strong drink neither pay them in old clothes but buy them such as was strong and new and give them full the worth of what they bought I hoped that no friend would be cross to the Indians although the land was now much improved and cleared not to refuse to let them build their houses or cabins on their ground if they should want for they must be somewhere and as timber was become scarce and dear that we speak calmly and peaceably to them and let them know that as timber is now scarce they must endeavor to make the best of it and when they cut a stick to make the best of it and work it all that is fit for use but not to refuse them that liberty and when we cut a tree that may suit them cut off a piece for them this I believe would prevent their wasting the timber giving uneasy and preserve and brighten the chain of friendship that was between our fathers and their fathers at the first settling of this land for they lived in great friendship since my memory which is about sixty years ago for then there was many Indians and we lived as brothers for they was kind to us and we to them this makes me love Indians for I cannot forget it</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-11"><dateline><date when="1795-12-11">11 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> was at Evesham month meeting in company with several public friends here was much said some of which might have been spared if I had a true sense of the matter for I have often thought that a few words and that to the purpose is better than a great many when the life and power is wanting and it is my sense and judgment that our meeting for business ought to be for that purpose and that public friends if anything to say by way of ministry to be as short as may be so as to discharge the trust reposed in them and be clear for we have many public meetings and preaching is not wanting but life and power</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-12"><dateline><date when="1795-12-12">12 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this day in feeling sympathy I felt my mind turned towards the poor and afflicted first I visited an aged friend that seemed as though his time was nearly run out and the day’s work not done as I feared I urged him to use all diligence the little space of time was yet behind for he said he thought every hour would be the last I asked if this did not alarm him he said yes I told him it was an awful thing of brought so near as that death and judgment was the next thing to be entered on</p>
<p>I then visited a widow and her afflicted daughter that had married an unworthy husband they appeared much in the innocency and I did believe in favor with God both the mother and the daughter they was rejoiced to see a friend that could sympathize with them oh that none may join in marriage without divine counsel and to direct and then I believe there would but few so unequally yoked and unhappily married as now there is too many for want of this</p>
<p>I then visited some old Indians in old age and suffering condition with whom I had tender sense of feeling for I did believe the comforts of life was wanting their bedding laid on the wet ground and was no more but a little straw their clothes scanty and cabin poor I thought it was likely they often wanted for a little comfortable nourishment as one of them was between eighty and ninety and her daughter upwards of sixty and she blind these both widow and consequently not able to support themselves I did believe this case called for friends care and speedy help</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1795-12-14"><dateline><date when="1795-12-14">14 the 12 month 1795</date></dateline><p> this is our month meeting we had the company of several friends from a distance there was several things came before the meeting that of distilled spirits this was sharply spoke to by several who thought that to make a free use of cider and wine it would have a tendency to weaken the cause and their own hands hang down and friends not to keep spirits in their houses but as formerly in apothecary’s shops only for there was a fire in some that the use of cider and wine increased however there was a committee appointed to have the care in that case and make report but I had a belief the cause was flattening and friends grew weaker and the world gained the ascendency and preference in the hearts of almost all a little few excepted who has not bowed to Baal nor kissed his image

and further was recommended the mind of the yearly meeting respecting the Indians that lived in the wilderness from whom the white people had taken their land and destroyed their hunting and have drove them so far that now it is hard for them to live by hunting and now they wish to learn to be farmers and to be instructed in husbandry and have schools and learn to read and write so that they may read the scriptures and be instructed in our principles this I did write with as I was of the belief we was much indebted to them and more so to those on whose land we do reside that are in straightening circumstances and hard beset for the necessities of life a number of which are far advanced in life to these my mind was most towards and wished that a few friends might be appointed to visit them and inspect their circumstances and afford them immediate relief if need this was united with and a committee appointed and entered on our minutes this I told them would be a credit to the next generation to see our kindness to the Indians</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1796-01-11"><dateline><date when="1796-01-11">11 the 1 month 1796</date></dateline><p> this is our month meeting at this time was the extracts of the year 1795 read a second time in which was advised against a worldly spirit and the debilitating effects proceedings there from not only in following the vain custom of the world in dress and address but in buildings and furniture and sumptuous living and pompous shows at marriages as also the neglect of attending meetings and sleeping when there at this time was very evident amongst us and a worldly spirit the ground cause of all these complaints that such as would be rich for the sake of being rich I clearly saw this struck at the root of the matter but putting put those advices in practice would come clost[?] home and that the rich would hardly hear it especially the parents more so than their children but I thought I saw in the true light a way that might be profitable and how to put in practice these most solitary advices that was to appoint two friends out of each meeting to treat in a tender feeling manner with such as gave occasion in any of these matters be them young or old and after such labor and patient waiting could not be prevailed on to take their friends’ advice the overseers stand ready when informed to extend further care and if they cannot be reclaimed to bring forward such cases this I gave as my sense in that meeting but the rich began to fend off and would not suffer such an appointment but began to say who was clean-handed enough for such an appointment some said not one I said we was poor indeed if so it was high time something was done</p>
<p>also I spread before the meeting a fear that for some time had attended my mind on account of a school being set up in Haddonfield to encourage the youth and others to learn the French language here I thought I saw a danger and snare laid for the feet of the dear youth and that it opened a door for popularity and would be like to lead in to unprofitably mixing with persons of loose conduct and bad principles this this seemed to fret some of the promoters for they supposed to have been highly applauded but there was many both young and old that united with me and was glad that it was mentioned in so public a place for I did believe that 
<pb n="69"/>
those that did go into it should consider well the grounds of their movement and take friends’ advice previous thereunto for I believe this to be more of that worldly spirit now if we could be favored to teach our children humility and self-denial this perhaps with a blessing might prove of lasting advantage when time to us shall be no more here this time loudly calls for when it is evident the judgments of the Lord is in this land for often is the sound of mortality in our ears and the cry of the widow and fatherless children and yet the people’s hearts remain hard oh how many of late have been taken parents from children and children and some in a short warning oh that all may be concerned to be ready when death comes for then ready or not we must go and leave all to another state of being that is never to have an end</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1796-01-12"><dateline><date when="1796-01-12">12 the 1 month 1796</date></dateline><p> was at Woodbury month meeting here was revived that of a worldly spirit here again I opened my prospect and what would be regaining that which we have lost by extortion when we have produce to dispose of we let moderation appear which would be loud preaching if when pork by the hog fetch six pence a pound then friends sell for four pence or five pence and so in proportion this would be far more to the honor of the cause of truth and the principle we profess than for friends to the foremost in asking and taking the highest price which now {savors} stink of extortion this has been a stumbling block to many honest enquirer this was but a poor low time amongst the people they seemed to have rather gone back than forward since the last time I was here which is some time the meeting seemed dull dull dull</p></div>

<p>after this visited an ancient friend as also two women that was in a poor state of health one of which diseased in two days after I visited a Methodist family who appeared religiously disposed they was very tender and expressed satisfaction</p></div>
