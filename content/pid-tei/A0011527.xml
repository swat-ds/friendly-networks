                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<div type="entry"><p>Sitting by my fire this evening I was brought into a state of reflection about a small visit I performed in the neighborhood of North Wales in the State of Pennsylvania and thinking some of my kind young friends in that place would like to know how I come to do it and advantage I thought to receive by it and not knowing but an account of it writing would be of use to them I thought I would just sit down and relate the as near as my recollection would serve all the occurrences that was pleasing and those that were not. I left home on Second Day in the morning went I. Rowland's in order to get some necessary things that should want while I was on the visit but being detained there three or four hours longer than I expected did not get to <persName key="w6xm0dbv">Josiah Roberts</persName> house till they had just done dinner Josiah's wife Mary informed me that Jos[indecipherable] had gone in his chair to</p>

<p>After taking dinner at <persName key="w6xm0dbv">Josiah</persName> I walked to uncle Joseph Matlack's enquiring if <persName key="w6xm0dbv">Josiah</persName> had come. My cousin informed me that Henry Warrington Jr. had taken the pains to assist them in getting to the river and making no stay walked on till I met Henry returning back in the chair who seemed a little surprised at seeing me come so late. I told him the reason, asking him if he thought I might cross the river handy and after a little more conversation with him</p>
<pb n="004" facs="335056"/>
<p>I told him I had come to this conclusion: if when I come to the river and there was so much ice or it was so much I could not get across I would just turn about and go home and be content, he told me I must not be discouraged to but if it so happened that I did not cross come back to his house and he would take me early next morning in time to the river that I might get to Byberry Meeting. I signified to him I would go to the river and wait for and opportunity to cross and if should fall out that I got over safe then I would look upon it as a good sign for me to think I was going <gap/> so biding him farewell</p>
<p>When I got to the river the ferryman said I was a lucky man to come just in the right time for good crossing.</p>
<p>I asked if he thought there was any such thing as luck. Getting into the boat we had a long discourse on what luck was when I reached Pennsylvania shore I gave him 25 cents for my ferriage bidding him farewell.</p>
<p>From here I walk up to Byberry and staid all night at my father-in-law's, not going to bed until I had inform them how I had crossed the river</p>

<persName key="w65t3wn2">Samuel Smith</persName> spoke a few words as the opening of this sitting the meeting then proceeded to the queries and answers. After the 1st query was read and answers from the several quarters to the same some very good remarks were made to the deficiencies that appeared in our members by the answer by William Flanner, Jesse Kersey and several other Friends. Kersey observed that if parents were rightly concerned for themselves other souls being made alive in truth that children would be benefited by observing that was the case with the father whose soul and that of his on would come to be bound in one and the same communion.</p>

<p>2nd query and answer thereto being read, <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> was engage to make an observation on this and the former one.</p>
