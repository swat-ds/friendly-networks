            </opener>
            <p>
            In a degree of that love that nearly unites in spirit, do I write to thee to inform thee a little of our present situation I think I may venture to inform thee that thy labors of love amongst us has not been wholly lost. I think my husband has taken part if he doth but be faithful it will be such a blessing as will afford the greatest comfort to me. Hannah Sleeper acquaints us as thy long journey to the southward which I hope may be attend<add>ed</add> with more ease than I have any idea of but of earnestly desire that thou may be made able to perform it to the glory of him that hath called thee there. We received thy kind letter which was refreshing and edifying. Samuel Sleeper and his wife appear to be very thoughtful, respecting the value of heavenly treasure and seems in some good degree humbled under the enjoyment, thereof, we have some refreshing season when we meet, with ardent longings that the merciful Creator of all things will in his own time compassionate our condition and in the riches of his goodness condescend to favor us with his goodness which transcends all temporal enjoyments.
            </p>

                <p>my husband with Samuel Sleeper and his wife remember their love to thee &amp; thine</p>
