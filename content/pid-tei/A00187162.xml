We also visited an Indian nation or town where resided about three hundred men, women, &amp; children they looked as the natives you see t<damage><gap/></damage> d<damage><gap/></damage> former way of dress with but breeches, both men and wo<damage><supplied>men</supplied></damage> with painted faces, breastplates, earrings, &amp; nose jewels <gap reason="illegible"/> their chief was a solid, wise, good, kind man. We was kindly received by him &amp; bid us welcome in the evening he brought one son to interpret, he wanted to know my business &amp; why I left my home so far I showed my certificate he said it was very good, he said he was glad to see me &amp; to hear words from me but I should soon go away &amp; he might forget them but if I would be pleased to leave him something in writing that he could see when I was gone for he had ever heard of Quakers or Friends before &amp; should be glad to be acquainted with their principles for he was not satisfied that their priests would not let his children learn english &amp; read the scriptures &amp; wanted to know what I thought was the reason I told him, the priest as I did believe was not willing, they should think for themselves for fear they should find a better principle then his was &amp; so leave him &amp; pay him no more money he said he was of the same belief but

            but he intended his children should learn to read english that they might read the scriptures to him &amp; other books <damage><gap/></damage> things was interpreted to him he ascented by the youth &amp; some unto would say it was good. I left him some books as a letter in writing to his satisfaction, he entertained us well that night &amp; when I parted, he bid me welcome &amp; said he hoped he should see me again at Montreal, my dear wife &amp; children I h<damage><supplied>ad</supplied></damage> as common some <gap reason="illegible"/> baptizing seasons such as I cannot describe to you in this strange kind of a language I cannot understand and yet I find some tender hearted, honest inquiries that it is to their comfort &amp; mine to though labor is hard &amp; the field wide but my dear master is a rich rewarder. I cannot say I lack anything I find I have lost all my judgment &amp; lead so contrary to my own judgment that I have left thinking today what I shall do tomorrow but believe the shepherd of Israel will not put his sheep forth, but he will prepare the way before them. I get but slowly on, for I find more to do by far than what I looked for. I have been at no great expense as yet, but now money goes fast, for things is scarce &amp; dear, but I have my hearth as <damage><gap/></damage> had I shall have a<damage><gap/></damage> I have a companion &amp; a pilot so there is three in company &amp; we travel in great harmony. My pilot is a man suitable for the task. so I conclude with my heart feeling love to you my dear wife &amp; children &amp; bid you fair well &amp; am your loving husband, father &amp; friend. But when I shall see you I cannot tell.
