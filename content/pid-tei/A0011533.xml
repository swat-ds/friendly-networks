                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<div type="entry" n="1821-08-05"><head><supplied>August 1821</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1821-08-05">5th of the Eighth Month, 1821.</date></dateline><p> First Day. A more lively, open, owning meeting than common, I believe – but I am very jealous and afraid of being deceived, as thousand and tens and hundreds of thousands and millions, I verily believe, are in their state as to religions. We have very deceitful hearts and a subtle, deceitful enemy to deal with, and of all deceivers self deception is the worst. How often is the caution repeated in Scripture: be ye not deceived, beware lest your hearts deceive you,<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 11:16</note> etc., etc.</p>
<p>It is a very pinching time of drought just here with us, although there has been rain almost all round us. The corn and buckwheat and potatoes seem to languish very much – some potato vines quite dead, and it looks as there would be no corn if rain does not come soon, even where it looked very promising but a few days ago.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-06"><dateline><date when="1821-08-06">6.</date></dateline><p> I went to the blacksmith's, my son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName>, to get my wagon mend[ed], and whilst I was waiting for that I went to see Benjamin Burroughs, a poor old man that has lost his reason and seems very likely to starve himself to death. [He] is now very poor and lean of flesh. [He] does not speak to any one; has never paid any attention to religion of any sort, but been industrious, and raised up a family of children. So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 6:11</note></p>
<p>Then I went to see their school next the meeting house, and had no cause to repent it – for the better, I hope. Then I went to see <persName key="w6hb9wqh">John Evans</persName>, died Twelfth Month. An old acquaintance and companion. In folly, he had a large plantation [indecipherable] to him, but has never done any good, neither in church or state. He has of latter time been very much afflicted with the gravel, and is very feeble. He seemed disposed to read religious books, and told me if he had his time to live over again, it would not be as it had been. I once heard an old man say his future state must be as it is, I cannot alter it now. It is too late for me to alter it now. What need there is to work while it is called today.</p>
<p>Then I went to see the widow Dudley, a young widow with 4 children. And called to see a poor widow whose husband died very sudden and left 3 children lately. All in sight of the meeting house.</p>

What small matters disturbs our peace, small matters disturbs still waters.</p>
<p>It holds remarkably clear: still hot, dry weather. The pastures are in places turned brown. Although we hear of fine rains in divers places, round about us it looks as if our Indian corn and buckwheat would be much cut off.</p>

What a mercy we are delivered from such a priest's yoke! We read that men were first created pure, but they have sought out many inventions, many many indeed, to their own hurt – things which the Lord never commanded them.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-11"><dateline><date when="1821-08-11">11th: Seventh of the week.</date></dateline><p> My daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> and I, with Mary Gibbs of Philadelphia, went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting, which, on retrospection, is not unpleasant to think of. A great favor to be so far preserved. Dined at John Stokes; had a little pause at parting – for the better, I hope, although the waters seemed low. Very dry weather.</p></div>
<pb n="003" facs="335219"/>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-12"><dateline><date when="1821-08-12">12 of the Eighth Month, 1821.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting. Waters very low. A dry time, both outwardly and as to religion. Very destitute of life, yet there seemed some things of life at last. Rebecca Price of Philadelphia had acceptable service.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-13"><dateline><date when="1821-08-13">13.</date></dateline><p> It is so dry; all our mills round about us cannot grind. This day I took a grist to Benjamin Tomlinson's mill at Timber Creek, about eight miles south of us. There seemed something like scrambling work about getting grain ground, there being so very few mills that can grind any now. I was very kindly entertained, although amongst a people where no religion prevails. I found [that] they lived on the failings of religious professors and I thought of a short sermon of <persName key="w6md3mdh">Robert Walkers</persName>, which was: starve the Devil. So I wish we might not feed those who live on the failing of others, for it is very poor diet. One said, many go constant to meeting and not for the better. This is the very place where old Ephraim lived, an extraordinary elder and an excellent, exemplary friend.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-16"><dateline><date when="1821-08-16">16.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting. I did think we should have a quite shut up, silent meeting (and it was so to me), but there was several little appearances just at last – savory and lively.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-19"><dateline><date when="1821-08-19">19.</date></dateline><p> First Day. <persName key="w6xm0dbv">Josiah Roberts</persName> went with me to Rancocas meeting. The waters appeared to me to be very low, I could [not] see nor feel any signs of any growth in true religion but a match for anything in caring for the outward man, which made hard work getting along. Yet through mercy it was an open, owning time at last, and openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at last to general satisfaction, I believe.</p>
<p>Seventh Day night. There was a fine soaking shower about Moorestown and further northward, but we had but very little here.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-23"><dateline><date when="1821-08-23">23.</date></dateline><p> At our preparative meeting. Lively and open, if it was of the right sort. Holds most awfully dry weather. Pastures scorched up.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-26"><dateline><date when="1821-08-26">26.</date></dateline><p> First Day Morning. Vice stings us even in our pleasures, but virtue consoles us even in our pains.</p></div>
<pb n="004" facs="335220"/>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-26"><dateline><date when="1821-08-26">26.</date></dateline><p> First Day, Eighth Month, 1821. At our meeting. Hannah Smith of Burlington had savory, acceptable service. A satisfactory meeting to me at last. This afternoon, I went to see the First Day boys' school close to the meeting house and also went to see their girls' school. About fifty little girls, mostly about five, six or seven years old, and several Black children. And went to see Nathan Morgan, and it was not unpleasant to look over the day's work at night.</p>
<p>A certain author on the education of children says: they should serve as to the Lord and not to men, and think not of their pensions or perspicuities, so much as that the most important, the most honorable, of all employments is committed to your care. Reflect how great will be your reward for the exact discharge of your duties as you educate these children; they will educate theirs, and so on, till time shall be no more. And if you thus turn many to righteousness, you will shine the stars for ever for so doing, and those under your care become blessings to the world in every station of life and bright angels to all eternity.</p>
<p>It is said of <persName key="w66124pd">John Pemberton</persName>, who was a wealthy man, that health, wealth, strength of body, and the comforts of this life were sacrificed to the service of his Divine Master. But as to our schools, I fear we have lost sight of what they should be or what the teachers of schools should be. Let them read the account of Waltham Abbey School taught by John Mattron, who was a worthy minister and deeply concerned for the children's improvement in religion as well as school learning. And his earnest concern was wonderfully blessed, for the Lord did manifest himself amongst them in their meetings, in their school, in a distinguished, powerful manner to the tendering their hearts in a wonderful manner. And when their teacher died, many of the children gave testimonies concerning their teacher and spoke of the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven – more like men and women established in religion than like children in their minority! I wish we might not sit down contented until we attain to the same religious experience, which would be the greatest blessing to the succeeding generation and also to the whole nation.</p>
<p>It is education forms the tender mind, / Just as the twig is bent, to so it's inclined. As one said, he supposed if he had been breed amongst the heathens, pagans, Turks, or Mehomits [Muslims] he should have been one of that sort.</p></div>
<pb n="005" facs="335221"/>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-28"><dateline><date when="1821-08-28">28th of Eighth Month, 1821.</date></dateline><p> I went to Burlington Quarterly Meeting with my two daughters. Poor and empty, begging for preservation, and although the house was full, I thought poverty prevailed and Burlington seemed lowering instead of rising. There was no <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> there, nor <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn</persName>. Burlington is now much stripped of their old standard bearers, yet there were divers young ministers appeared: Edwin Atley of Philadelphia appeared in prayer, and <persName key="w6b01gx6">John Coxe</persName> expressed that he thought there was something owning attended the meeting. I was so far preserved as not to do any thing that I wished undone when I came at midnight to look over the day, which I count a very great favor. Had some pretty close remarks on the state of society and also in the sitting for worship.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-30"><dateline><date when="1821-08-30">30.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. No satisfaction. Our standing is in slippery places.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-08-31"><dateline><date when="1821-08-31">31.</date></dateline><p> Our select meeting [was] a mortifying time to me. Mortifying things from different quarters, what a world of troubles and dangers it is! I am told that the drought is very severe and divers distant places, especially in some of the West India islands and Cuba. That the Negroes cannot raise enough to keep themselves, and it is said many of them starve to death for want of sustenance. It is said these accounts are in the newspapers.</p>
<p>A few days ago Samuel Cooper, son of Benjamin, a young man just arrived to age, died. An orderly, steady, young man with a kind of a fever. And another by the name of Anderson about 17, they died near together on the river shore. And it is said that this fever (some different from what they called the typhus fever) prevails very much over a great part of Pennsylvania.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-02"><head><supplied>September 1821</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1821-09-02">2nd of the Ninth Month, First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Rebekah Burr of Evesham had a pretty deal to say, savory and acceptable, I believe. A young man of Byberry tells me some fields of corn is quite spoiled with the drought, so that they turned the cattle into the fields of corn. This day the rain seemed to come more freely than it has done since harvest. Looks like a change of weather from very dry to wet, though we hear of there being rain in places round about us. We hear of three drowned – a steamboat ran over them. A man and two sons; and left a widow and seven children. How many solemn calls and how soon forgotten!
<pb n="006" facs="335222"/>
We hear of many being drowned in the storm in the late storm of wind I hear that Joseph Swett's mill is swept all away with this last sudden great flood of rain: it is very likely there was a great deal of grain in it how many solemn calls to humility after divers ways and manners: and yet how much pride and ingratitude abounds may we not say with the Prophet pride hath budded<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 7:10</note> iniquity hath blossomed and brought forth a plentiful crop: although some now say they think there will not be more than half a crop of Indian corn and potatoes and buckwheat less.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-06"><dateline><date when="1821-09-06">6 of the Ninth Month, 1821, Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our monthly meeting most of which was satisfactory but one matter before our monthly made very difficult troublesome work; many troubles might be easily avoided if we would take the right way for it.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-09"><dateline><date when="1821-09-09">9.</date></dateline><p> First Day. Mariah Embree of Trenton had considerable to say and some thought it a good satisfactory time but to me it was but a low time I want to feel our meetings crowned with life and with we might not sit down contented without it. Here is a remark I just now met with in a letter from a friend, piety and pride can no more thrive together than health and sickness: if so what will become of our religion in our days wherein there is such a rapid growth in pride. Nothing pleases a man more than to think he has avoided a foolish action it is a great mercy and favor to be so far preserved as to do nothing we shall have cause to wish undone and not be crying out (as some do all their life) we have done that which we ought not to have done and left undone that which we ought to have done. Our select meeting middling some satisfaction.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-12"><dateline><date when="1821-09-12">12 of the Ninth Month.</date></dateline><p> At our quarterly meeting. The house pretty full and our galleries pretty well filled with able, amicable ministers, and we had a great deal of preaching. Several from Philadelphia and several from Nine Partners, Isaac Thorn and his wife. But preaching seems to do but little where people are set down and conclude [to] go no further, which seems to be the case with the professors of religion in the present day. If there was a desire to enquire of the Lord a right way for them and their little one to walk in, their state would be different. Some satisfaction, although not that life as at some times.</p></div>
<pb n="007" facs="335223"/>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-14"><dateline><date when="1821-09-14">14.</date></dateline><p> Ninth Month, 1821. A young man returned just now from Salem tells me it is a very sickly time there-a-way, and he says many wealthy families cannot get nurses to take care of them. <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers's</persName> son of Evesham brought up a corpse from there yesterday, a young man. How often humbling things overtake poor mortals, and how does pride and luxury look and an afflicting, humbling, circumstances. See <title>Select Lives</title>, page 95, Fenelon: The true riches and prosperity of a state consists in pruning the luxuries of living, and being content with simple and innocent things or pleasures. By this the demonstrates that true virtue does not only fit men for a state of happiness hereafter, but that it actually makes societies of people happy even in this life, as far as it is capable of being so. No doubt it is the will of our great Creator that his people should be happy, and is there not a way cast up whereby they may attaint to present and future happiness? But it is not to be attained in pride and luxury, but in resignation and humility. </p>

<p>I am grown old and not able to carry on business. Crops fail and my wife very poorly. All prospects as to the outward looks gloomy; whilst my neighbors all round are carrying on business all around me, I feel like one of the hindmost amongst human beings. Blessed is the man that walketh not in the council of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners.<note type="editorial">Psalm 1:1</note> Blessed, blessed, blessed indeed are they who walk in the way that leads to the abodes of the blessed. But for want of this, oh, to see and feel the unhappiness, disorder, misery, and confusion that abounds amongst us poor mortals, which might be easily avoided by taking heed to the reproofs of instruction, the way of life. But for want of this may we not say, the quadruped, the insect, and the fly fill up their station better far than I.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1821-09-15"><dateline><date when="1821-09-15">15.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting quite silent, which is rare with us. This afternoon at 4th hour Isaac Thorn and his wife, from Nine Partners, had a meeting here at Moorestown house. Full crowded. They both had a great deal to say, she especially. Much pertinent council they preached till sundown, but alas, how little good it seems to do, how soon all forgotten! Yet we don't know it may be as bread cast upon the waters and found after many days with some.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1821-09-16"><dateline><date when="1821-09-16">16th of the Ninth Month, 1821.</date></dateline><p> Second Day. I went to <persName key="w68q6r38">Micajah Will's</persName> to get some shingles for our kitchen. Whilst I was there waiting for him to come home, I picked up some newspapers (which the children were throwing about the floor) wherein I found accounts of the late great sudden fall of rain and hard wind. It appears it was a very great deal harder eastward than it was here. At New York and Long Island and in New England it is said the roofs were blown off many houses. Some houses blown down, and people killed, and divers barns blew down, and many cattle killed, and their cellars and stores filled and spoiled with the sudden inundation of water, ruined their wharves and stores. Thus they were visited with a violent storm, and it is said forty vessels or more were shipwrecked on their coasts and many lives lost. Many dead bodies were found on their shores – 30 or 45, it is said, found on Long Island. Ships were wrecked and torn to pieces in many places and ports.</p>
<p>See Psalms 50 chapter 22 verse: Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver. If we did but consider how many ways for humbling things to overtake, and how often they do overtake people, it would seem a wonder that pride, ingratitude, and forgetfulness should ever prevail amongst human beings, which brings such destruction often and misery upon many in these days as we read in Scripture it did on the people in days of old. And yet I read in the same papers an account of most grievous sorrowful work in the southern states, of their kidnapping and grievously oppressing the poor Negroes – although call after call has been given, warning after warning has been sent from heaven.</p>
<p>See Deuteronomy 7 and 21: the Lord thy God is a mighty God and terrible; 10 and 21: hath done for the terrible things. Job says 37 and 22: with God is terrible majesty. And see Psalms 65 and 5: by terrible things in righteousness will he answer us; [66 and] 5: terrible in his doings towards the children of men; 146 and 6: men shall speak of thy terrible ones is as a storm; the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 25:4-5</note> No doubt many have been brought very low and much reduced by the late terrible storm in a few minutes, and many drowned and very suddenly taken away, and many left in sorrow and mourning and very bitter, humbling circumstances.</p>

Isaac Thorn and his wife were there and had abundance to say – both of them, but she especially. And the people were very attentive and still. But although we could say their conduct was most decorous, how much better it would be if it could be said they were evidently making the best use of their time to make their peace with God, as was said of one very near his end? And of another, who was so devoted to do all the good he could that they said of him they did not believe he lost one minute? And of another, devoted, dedicated servant of the Lord that he said he did not desire to spend one minute to please himself? If the people were like-minded with the people in the days of Ezra, when they sat down by the river Ahava to enquire of the Lord a right way for them and their little ones to walk in,<note type="editorial">Ezra 8:21</note> they would be in a much more fit and more favorable state to hear the tidings of the Gospel preached than they now are, set down at ease where they now are, seemingly not desirous to go any further. But if we were all so much in earnest to make our calling and election sure as not to be desirous to spend one minute to please ourselves – as <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> said he was, or as they said of Fenelon or Du Renti [?] so intent upon doing all the good he could as not to lose one minute – would it be too much to obtain the answer of will done at last or should we ever have cause to repent it? No, no, is it not the way everlasting which David prayed to be led into,<note type="editorial">Psalm 139:24</note> never to be repented of?</p></div>

But alas, to think that Noah was a preacher of righteousness, we are told, an hundred years before the flood – yet wickedness prevailed until it was said all flesh had corrupted their ways and the flood was sent that swept them all away except Noah and his family. And Moses was called a prophet, and his people were a gainsaying, backsliding people, and all fell in the wilderness and were not suffered to enter the promised land except Caleb and Joshua. And were the people Christ had to preach to any better? Very many of them [were not], for see how they crucified him at last. We now in our days have abundance of preaching, line upon line and precept upon precept, but are we coming up out of the wilderness or are we going back into it, conforming to the spirit of the world, which is enmity with God?</p></div>

Yet however it was an open satisfactory time in general, I believe. They showed loving, kind, and inviting at parting. We dined at George Chandler's, whose wife had sent word to me wishing I would come and see her. Has been many weeks very poorly and very much afflicted and confined with the rheumatism. Better, but cannot walk yet. She expressed satisfaction with the visit.</p>
<p>On our way home, we called to see Jemime Hurley, my sister's daughter, who stays at her brother-in-law's, James Hileis; very ill with the dropsy, and appears near her end.

<p>See the words of James Meikle, page 35: I found that to live near God was the sweetest life in the world, and sweetens every condition; but I find that although the world could say but little against me, conscience could say a great deal. But oh, what a black life was mine when narrowly surveyed, when by meditation it was, as it were, taken to pieces. And see, page 32nd, were men as stupid about the things of this life as they are about the world to come, they would be a burden to society and useless in their generation. How deplorable is it then that they should be prudent in matters not of the last but of the least importance, and that even those who otherwise are indolent should perpetrate sin with the greatest activity when neither judgment nor mercies, promises or threatenings, patience nor examples of vengeance can prevail. Nothing can let them see their folly till awakened by the flames of Hell, when it is too late. Vanity of vanities, emptiness, and vapor are all the enchanting, delusive joys and pleasures, riches and treasures of this delusive world.</p>

See [Henry] Scougal <title>Life of God in the Soul of Man</title>, page 86: oh! what a poor thing would the life of man be if it were capable of no higher enjoyments than the things of this world can afford. Some call it a mere animal life, which is not influenced with the inspiration of the Almighty. Be ye not as the horse or as the mule, who have no understanding, says David the prophet [Psalm 32:9]. And how many there are who spend their days like the mole graveling in the earth, partaking daily of the bountiful gifts of Heaven; who like the swine eat the fruit under the tree, but never look up from whence it comes. But how will this do in the end?
I have heard of one of this sort who at last cropped out: of darkness, darkness, darkness and so died away. The language of another earthly world being was: at last now I must go and oh, that I might go in peace! Ten thousands of worlds, one upon the back of another, would not tempt me to live in this world as I have done! Although this was one who supported a good name amongst men and filled conspicuous stations in civil society, yet this was his language when he came to be awakened, to see the necessity of a truly religious life, the inward life, the life of God in the soul of man that is hid with Christ in God. As I once heard a poor, benighted, belated creature say, ten thousands of worlds would I now give if I had it in my power, if my peace was but made with the Lord. One says the life of those wholly devoted to earthly concerns may well be compared Nebuchadnezzar ate grass<note type="editorial">Daniel 4:33</note>; earthly things feed, fill, and satisfy both of them.</p></div>

Paul and Silas could sing praises in a prison [Acts 16:25] because when God giveth quietness none can cause trouble. Oh, how poor a thing would the life of man be if it were capable of no higher enjoyments than the joys and pleasures, riches and treasures this word can afford, says [Henry] Scougal (as remarked on the other side of this leaf). And the words of Meikle also: Oh, how poor are all earthly possessions to a person who has no peace within! See the Traveler, page 130: there is as great difference between a man in a renewed and unrenewed state as between a man fast asleep and broad awake. Think of the man we read of, who concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years, that would say: lo, his soul, eat drink and be merry or take his rest. So lo in the lap of pleasure, but the language was: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided? And so shall it be with all those who lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God.<note type="editorial">Luke 12:19-21</note> And again, see page 136: They are to beware that they do not stick on the sands of carnal security, or run into the shallow waters of lukewarm indifferency, or be blown on the rocks of bold confidence by the high winds of spiritual delusion. See what the Scriptures say concerning rejoicing in the Lord, and consider how such talk sounds in the ears of the earthly worldly minded.</p></div>

Penn thought before we betake ourselves to rest we [should] renew and examine all the passages of the day, that we may have the comfort of what we have done aright and may redress what we find to have been amiss, and make the shipwrecks of one day be as marks to direct our course in another. This may be called the very part of victorious living, and would contribute wonderfully to advance our reformation and preserve our innocency. But with all we must not forget to implore the divine assistance, especially against those sins that most easily beset us.

Again see [Henry] Scougal, page 74. No wonder then if souls overpowered with Divine love despise inferior pleasures and be almost ready to grudge the body it's necessary attention for the common accommodations of life, judging all these imperatives to their main happiness. I have read of divers of our first friends who were so enamored with the Divine life that were very desirous to make as little do for the body as would suffice nature (bread to eat and raiment to put on, etc.) that they might be the better enabled to do good and communicate to the poor and needy and be at liberty to serve the Lord. But alas, how few of that sort to what there have been of those whose language is what shall we eat what shall we drink, etc. And oh, how precious the effects and fruits of the one, and how direful the consequence of desires misplaced.</p></div>

See Meikle, page 215: a grey head and a carnal, worldly heart is a wounding sight, but a young man and an agued loved one in his prime and all his graces flourishing is comely to behold. Henceforth begone the bewitching vanities and all the enchantments of the world; the evening of my life is not to be trifled away by you. Death attends me, the grave awaits me, and eternity is at hand. Therefore may my purified affections river-like enlarge as they approach the ocean. Page 237: Why did I prostitute the temple of my soul to the idols of time? Why permit the world and self a place in that temple which the godhead is to inhabit forever? Page 239: Ah, was I ever so stupid, so brutish as to make any comparison between riches and righteousness, gold and glory, earth and heaven the creature and the creator or God!

It is dangerous to swim in hot seas where sharks along shores, where alligators devour – and doubly so to wallow in wealth and ease, where lusts and Satan destroy. 139: Jeshurun, who when he waxed fat, kicked, and in his greatness forgot him that make him great.<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 32:15</note> More venomous creatures crawl in these countries which never felt a cold day than in such as annually feel a pinching winter. So, generally speaking, more corruption (pride, lust, carnal security, wrath etc.) abound among such as are finally clothed and fare sumptuously every day than among those that sit down to one meal and know but little how to provide the next.
Seneca says prosperity, like a strong gale, soon carries a man out of sight of peace. Let us compare our lives with the faithful truly in earnest to give all diligence to make their calling and election sure so as not to lose one minute nor desire to expend one minute to please ourselves and keep our selves continually upon the stretch in doing all the good we could, both to the bodies and souls of men according to our ability of bodily strength and worldly wealth and estate. As it has been said of some, should we ever have cause to repent it or would it be too much to obtain the answer of well done, at last enter thou into the joys of thy Lord? But instead of a life so spent, [we] have to say: alas, what precious time and sweet meditation have I wasted on toys and trifles, and despised the joy of angels and the work of Heaven. When time is at an end here, may we not say: where are all the things of time now, which once made such great demands upon us? How they then sink into an insignificant nothingness, hardly a name little enough to call them by! And [we] have to say with Grotius: Alas, I have consumed much of my time in laborious doing of nothing; no treasure laid up in Heaven, nothing done to purpose, all vanity and vexation of spirit, bound on a voyage of awful length and dangers little known, a stranger to superior strength. Can man vainly trust his own? But oars alone can ne'er prevail to reach the distant cast; the breath of Heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost.</p></div>

A great difference between thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee and then it be with all who lay up treasure for themselves and are not rich towards God.<note type="editorial">Luke 12:19-21</note>: and to [indecipherable] done thou good and faith servant enter thou into the joy of thy Lord and into thy masters everlasting rest<note type="editorial">Matthew 25:21</note> I think Thomas à Kempis says while Jesus is present, all things are pleasant. As I just now noted, Armella Nicolas words: when the soul is blessed with the approbation of God whatever may befall it is easily supportable. But what would it profit a man if he gain the whole world and loose the favor of this almighty supporting power last? And what would a man give in exchange for his soul? Why this I have heard from one on a dying bed: then thousand of worlds would I give if it was in my power for peace with the Lord. And it has been the case with very many; likely it will be with many more.

There was a large number of ministers and I thought they were kept in beautiful order not disturbed with babblers. In the afternoon we had a right down, searching, scraping, lively time as with lighted candles on the state of society I had right good satisfaction at last a violent stormy day of rain and good snow.</p></div>

My son <persName key="w64v7902">Benjamin</persName> seen the corpse at the ferry it is said that the man that murdered the woman had a wife and several children yet was suspected of being too familiar with the young woman and others, and another dreadful account at Mount Holly. Two white girls with two Negro men stole some money, 30 dollars, and a wagon and horses and went as far as Trenton; there, their horses tired and they left them, and went on a foot. They pursued them and took them and brought them back to Holly goal. Another account says Caleb Bourton a native of Moorestown or near there died with a wound in his arm occasioned only by being bled; the doctor cut off the vein. He was a very tall, lusty, young man had in former years gave way to drink to excess but refrained and obtained a good name and reputation at school keeping, broke out again and gave way too much to strong drink, upon which I wrote him a letter of which I am now glad.</p></div>
