                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

There was crazy Rachel Shute and very troublesome. This afternoon went to the Negro meeting. Forepart I had something like hard labor and deep wading. But it was after a while a time of favor. All seemed satisfied. The Committee that had the care of the meeting agreed there was no room for discouragement.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1792-04-22"><dateline><date when="1792-04-22">22.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. I went to Newtown Little meeting which was small by reason of inoculation.

<div type="entry" n="1792-04-28"><dateline><date when="1792-04-28">[28.]</date></dateline><p> I sat off towards Salem. Lodged at Paul Cooper's. [notation] I dined at Joseph Sharp's he died in 1794.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1792-04-29"><dateline><date when="1792-04-29">29.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. I got down to a little meeting in Penns Neck which was to some satisfaction; then to Salem Select Meeting Second Day which was their monthly meeting at which the Quarter's Committee on Spirituous Liquors had agreed [to] meet and did meet and I think it was a lively favored time.</p>
<p>We, that is <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName>, <persName key="w6912v93">John Tatham</persName>, <persName key="w6gb2s37">Thomas Redman</persName>, myself and <persName key="w6b38ksb">James Cooper</persName> proceeded to Greenwich Monthly Meeting. Was at their Select Meeting and monthly meeting which was a time of openness for labor. We visited all the retailers of spirituous liquors in that village, and although they seemed to cling to the profits of selling rum etc. and though there seemed but little entrance to be made in the hearts of some yet we all agreed the labor was manifestly owned and the testimony raised in meetings as well as in some families. Parted with Friends with increasing feeling nearness and uniting regard.</p>
<p><persName key="w6912v93">John Tatham</persName> and I had some lively opportunities in several families over the creek and with Thomas Williams (and family) who was a servant to my father when I was a child, and at John Lanins who was an old playmate when we were boys, and at Samuel Reeves after this we had a solid opportunity with all the retailers in the town together which was to good satisfaction. Then came up to Piles Grove. Had an opportunity with a retailer there, then with another one at the Head of Timbercreek. Then I returned home and had peace of mind. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1792-05-12"><dateline><date when="1792-05-12">12.</date></dateline><p> Went to Select Meeting, a time to be remembered: and not with pleasantness. Such a time as we never had before, and hope to never have no more though it may work together for good and tend to profit. The apostle recommended an earnest contending for the faith, but then it should be in [illegible] right spirit great [he]ights end in [gr]eat D[epths] [illegible].

At our last Spring meeting I borrowed off <persName key="w66124pd">John Pemberton</persName> <title>Primitive Christianity</title> written by William Cave.<note type="editorial">William Cave, Primitive Christianity: or the Religion of the Ancient Christians...in three parts. London: printed for J. Walthoe et. al., 1728.</note> Read it through in about two weeks and since a very excellent piece called the art of contentment, in both of which are many things very deeply instructing.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1792-05-13"><dateline><date when="1792-05-13">13 of the Fifth Month.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. In the writings of Christopher Love, said to be one of the martyrs, page 103, speaking of the body. Here in this world your bodies are liable to many sufferings and many sorrows and dissipations – in heaven you shall bid sorrow and sighing fly away hence. Here, as the philosopher terms it, your bodies are but like an hospital wherein all are full of infirmities, all the members of the body are subject to passion and weakness, but in heaven they shall not be so. Here the body is a magazine of all kinds of diseases. Pliny tells us that in his time, the body was subject to three hundred several kinds of diseases, but now I say three times more. Many thousand infirmities the body in this world is subject to. See the prophet's words, None of the inhabitants ever shall says I am sick. Here our bodies tend to corruption, meat for worms, and thence proceeds loathsome savor. Eliphaz in Job calls it a house of clay, Paul a house of earth, the philosophers a moldering cottage. Ecclesiastes 12:7: Dust shall turn to earth, as it was subject evil and noisome diseases, a sink, dung a magazine of all infirmities. Here our bodies lumpish and heavy, here we are like tired jades that go on slowly in all divine employments, must be spurred on to all good duties etc. mention a possibility of being made more swift than the chariots [of] Amminadib<note type="editorial">Song of Solomon 6:12</note> in all the ways of God at our meeting and do believe it was a good meeting strengthening and satisfactory.</p></div>

This season, many harvest fields have been cut off by the Hessian fly, as they are called. Some fields of wheat, in divers places, have been blasted with a kind of mildew; yet on the whole there was a plentiful harvest, and a fine time to get it in. But some were reaping on the first-day; in which I thought I saw the danger of looking at the gifts, and forgetting the Giver; like the man we read of, whose ground brought forth plentifully, so that he concluded he would pull down his barns and build larger ones, that he might have room to bestow his fruits and his goods. But let it be remembered what was said to him, <q>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall be those things be which thou hast provided. So shall it be with all those who lay up treasure for themselves, and are not rich toward God.</q> There is danger of giving earthly treasures the preference, and so living far from the state of one formerly, who said, <q>Let my right hand forget her cunning, if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joy.</q> If we give anything the preference, we render ourselves unworthy of the Divine favor.</p>
    <p><q>If thy right hand offend thee, cut it off or thy right eye, pluck it out.</q> There have been many people under different denominations, who have chosen rather to part with the greatest outward comforts of this life, things that might be compared to a right hand, or right eye, rather than give anything the preference to the Truth; or comply with things which they believed were contrary to the Divine will; and many have not only given themselves up to suffer the most cruel tortures, but have even laid down their lives, rather than comply with what they thought was wrong. O'Leary, on Toleration, says, <q>Persecution, on the score of conscience, has thinned the world of fifty millions of human beings.</q> (264-265)</p></note></div>

I went with them to Cropwell and a poor low shut up time it was. Richard says it is mostly so at this season of the year. People work hard, douce into the spirit of this world till we are like creatures half drownded and so not in a capacity to perform the business. We met about a dull drowsy distressing meeting. I felt benumbed with the headache, yet I gathered this instruction: that it was not right nor never intended, though we are doomed to get our bread by the sweat of the brow [Genesis 3:19], for us to work so hard to get a living or to earn money to put into a bag with holes as to unfit us for the Lord's service. But it is to be feared it is much the case with professors.</p>

<p>Thomas Harrison from Philadelphia was here and informed me that the sickness prevailed and spread in the city. People died very fast and sudden so that thousands have moved into the country and are still moving out very fast so that business there is very much stopped and houses and stores much shut up. Joseph Dubre was here to see us and told me that the town seemed solitary or desolate the countenance of the people much changed and the streets as thin and still on weekdays as they used to be on First Day and one thing very remarkable that in this sickness and great mortality the Negroes had not been very little if any affected with the distemper in burying the dead, so that they are employed in waiting on the white people in a way very different from what they used to be. A very great and sudden change of times and things indeed, which stains the glory of all earthly things and turns the world upside down. See Acts 17 and 6, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also. About home sowing the rest of the week. Met with a very [illegible] trial this week, hard to [illegible].</p></div>

I was informed that just before this sickness began there was a young new married woman died in the city and they had a mahogany coffin plated with burnished gold and a kind of black curtains round the bottom which they call a paul [pall]. I was at a burial at Newtown some years ago where J. Burroughs told me that there was a double coffin but I did not look into the grave to see it, but he seemed displeased with it and said it seemed as if they thought their deceased connections were too good to touch the ground. And indeed I have often thought of that passage of scripture, see Deuteronomy 28:56, The tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness and tenderness etc. See verse the next, 57. But now they bury people they say often times without coffins and abundance of them that have coffins are made without plaining and entirely without their great forms and parade as usual at burials. We hear daily of the increase and spreading of the sickness all round us, burials almost every day and people afraid to go to burials or visit the sick.

But now they are all in an uproar – fifing and drumming and enlisting in the city, and exercising or learning the art of war in the country. And raising an army to go to war with the back western inhabitants at Fort Pitt and there away about their refusing to pay their taxes on their distilleries.</p>
<p>It has been brewing here ever since I was there two years ago and I have many times thought it was likely that their iniquities would be suffered to correct them and their backslidings reprove them for their wickedness in distilling the grain, as they have this many years past, so that for some months a few years ago, some were forced to live without bread, as I was informed in letter by one of my friends from Redstone.</p>

She said she was resigned to die but could not be resigned to live only on account of her children. She discovered a great concern and desire that she could do something for the good of her husband and children. Her sickness was a fever and very sick stomach, vomiting and flux. At divers times as I was with her she prayed for mercy and that she might have an easy passage saying, O Lord Jesus Christ be pleased to take me, expressing a hope that her time would not be long and at last was very sensible but a few minutes before she went off and seemed to have an easy passage at last.</p>

<p>I remember old <persName key="w6gg1k1v">Samuel Atkinson</persName> told me that they once thought the staff of bread would have been cut off by the rain after the grain was shocked in the harvest fields (called the wet harvest). I remember once seeing an account in the papers of a famine in Germany on account of the abundance of wet and I have known people who live on the best of our lands and farms forced to fodder in the Ninth Month on account of the drought and now some of our best farmers talk of buying hay, their grass and pasture is so spoiled. A talk of cattle growing cheap. I have known fields of corn withered and almost dried up with the drought by harvest, but this year exceeded all I ever remember for a growing season, the field covered with white clover all the forepart of summer.</p></div>

<p>Some thoughts on a part of meeting and some ministry some little time back and on the state of a meeting for discipline. There was the bell, but the pomegranate was wanting.<note type="editorial"> Journal inserts <q>There were offerings and sacrifices, but salt was wanting,</q> 272. Exodus 28:34 and 39:26.</note></p>
<p>See 1 of Corinthians 12 and 3 verse: No man can say Jesus is Lord but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>And see Jeremiah 5 and 2, though they say the Lord liveth they swear falsely.</p>
<p>Words and life are two things. Words without life are but like sounding brass and tinkling cymbals but with charity and life they are forcible and like apples of gold in pictures of silver.<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 13:1</note></p>
<p>See Exodus 20 and 25, If thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</p>
<p>And the Lord saw that the imagination of man's heart was only evil continually, see Genesis 6 and 5 verse.</p>
<p>As to the state of some and the state of some religious affairs handled by them: the worldly spirit, it is to be feared, has of latter time gained the ascendancy. It seems the Devil has had an opportunity of taking many up into an high mountain and shewing them the glories of the world and promising them [if] they will worship him all shall be theirs* and is it not greatly to be feared that many have closed with the proposal? And are not such like children diverted and delighted in a toy shop, selling their birthright for a mess of pottage<note type="editorial">Genesis 25:29-34</note> and hewing to themselves broken cisterns?<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:13</note> Has not the earth opened her mouth and swallowed many up who, in this day of prosperity and great opportunity of getting money, so, by being snared with the unlawful love of lawful things, rendered themselves unworthy of the master's company [and] so become greatly weakened and wounded.</p>

<quote type="block"><p>One fear hath continually attended me, namely of going before my guide and leader Christ Jesus. I bless the Lord, my heart is fixed in his blessed truth, and I have his comfortable presence with me and I am glad of the least ray of his heavenly light. O what great things he hath done for me, who hath redeemed my soul from death and my feet from falling and made his cup of love to overflow and with honey out of the rock hath satisfied me. Endless praises be ascribed to him for his mercy endureth forever. And still this word of heavenly council is with me: Wait; wait; for though God is faithful who hath promised and will perform his promise; yet the times and season he hath put in his own power and we are to wait to feel that power that raised Jesus from the dead.</p>
<p>There is life and safety in waiting in the stillness; for when the natural man or fleshly part is silenced then is the season for God to work; and as dear Mary Gulson said to me and I have experienced: <said>when we are got into the true stillness the enemy cannot come to hurt, for he hath nothing to work upon when the flesh is silent.</said></p></quote>
<p>This seems consonant with a remark I seen in the works of John Crook which as near as I remember was this: <quote>when the mind thinketh nothing and the body acteth nothing nor the soul craveth nothing contrary to the will of the Almighty then there is true peace and solid satisfaction.</quote></p></div>

only giving time between meetings for a little refreshment.</p>
<p>Many of our sittings were highly favored seasons. Some of our ancient Friends said they thought they never seen a meeting better conducted. Some sittings were to favored times and some very dull and trying and even these were deeply instructing, letting me see there was no way to be right but to watch and to beg to labor or starve to resist the enemy, to fight or die. We had one most remarkable sitting one evening at <persName key="w66124pd">John Pemberton's</persName> widow's house wherein <persName key="w6kx66c3">Peter Yarnall</persName> was favored in prayer in a distinguished manner. Got home Seventh Day night with <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> who attended this Yearly Meeting with me. I thought I never seen more love nearness and sweetness before amongst Friends.</p>
<p>I was on a committee on a case brought from Rahway Quarterly [meeting] concerning a mulatto woman that requested to have a right amongst Friends, of whom Friends gave a very favorable account, but Friends could not unite in receiving her, on account of her color, so brought the case to this Yearly Meeting.</p>
<p><persName key="w65147nn">Martha Routh</persName> from Europe and Mary Mifflin, Ann Mifflin and with a considerable number of others, weighty wise solid women Friends, likewise a number of men Friends who were not of our committee attended and gave in their testimony in a solid manner and it was a heart tendering time even to tears. <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> and <persName key="w65t3wn2">Samuel Smith</persName> appeared on behalf of this cause and all unanimously united with John De Marsillac that there was never an discipline to prohibit from being received into membership on account of color or nation whatsoever and so we took in our report to the Yearly Meeting without that Monthly Meetings should be at liberty to receive all such where they were convinced of their sincerity without distinction of nation or color, with which the Yearly Meeting heartily united, and I think I [had] never seen any matter in which there was such a united feeling. Abraham Gibbins and <persName key="w6cz4d1t">Warner Mifflin</persName> were likewise strong and staunch in this cause. No opposition appeared.</p>
<p>There was that which raised the testimony in this respect over all opposition, although the spirit of prejudice which had been imbibed on account of color had kept it back above twenty years within which time many or divers Black and mulatto people have requested to have a right amongst Friends but till now have been rejected and put by on account of their color.</p>
<p>About home this week gathering in our fall crop [of] buckwheat potatoes etc. but we attended our preparative meeting and Monthly Meeting which were attended with some degree of life though much is wanting and I fear in this time of peace and prosperity we are declining and growing dry and formal, though some dew.</p>

<p>At this Monthly Meeting one matter was very disagreeable to me. Friends, all but four: I.C., A. W., H.W., and me concluded to drop off [the] practice of women's bringing their certificates themselves into the men's meeting, which to me seemed going back, for I believe we went into it in the life when the meeting was in a growing state and now dropped it when it is quite other ways.</p></div>

<p>Death is certain to all but the time when the place where and the manner how is a secret. But certain it is many and various are the ways by which people are taken away as various instances a few week past verify.</p>
<p>Several three were drowned in the river since the late severe frost and a few week ago two men were burnt to death in a cabin at the cedar swamp. One's name was Cox, a young man burnt partly almost all up, the other's name was West, had a wife and several children, was burnt so bad that he died in a few days and suffered very much. And a few weeks ago just before I was at Morris's River a house was burnt in the night and a Black woman and a Black child and a white child was burnt up at Morris's River. And we have divers times been informed that a house was burnt in it 14 of the Ninth Month last- a man and his wife were killed with the thunder in bed eastward towards Prince town [Princeton]. The woman had a young child in her bosom and that was much burnt but like to recover.</p>

Extract of part of a letter out of Isaac Pennington's Letters, page 83, Yet one thing more, O mind it, it is more (as to the nature of the thing) to meet with one little touch of power upon a man[‘s] spirit to wrap him up into high enjoyments, or to enable him to speak great things of the mysteries of God's kingdom, for it changes his heart more, it helps him on his journey more, it prepares his spirit more for the Lord, it adds to his growth more than the other. Yea the other will hurt him unless his spirit be poised by the Lord, and made able to bear it. But the still working of the power, which secretly melteth and changeth the mind renewing it (as it were insensibly) daily more into the image: that is the safe precious profitable ministration of life. O wait for it and be sensible of the tender mercy and goodness of the Lord as he leads you into and keeps you in it.</p>
<p>And see Mary Peasley or Neale rather * page 43, As I quietly rode along the Lord was pleased in mercy to break in upon my mind by his living presence and power and it became the language of my soul, <pb n="060" facs="sc203767"/></p>
<p>soul, speak Lord and thy servant will hear. [1 Samuel 3:9] After which many things were divinely opened to me wherein I greatly rejoiced and was thankful to the Lord my God. I then found a sudden but gentle rebuke and heard as it were a voice that said in the secret of my soul, the dispensations thou most delightest in are least pleasing to me and not so beneficial to thy soul, as that pure poverty of spirit, brokenness and contrition of heart, which brings into humility of mind and the reason why this is so little desired and so unpleasant to the creature is that it can have no part therein but is wholly excluded and set at naught; can discover no beauty or excellency in it and for this cause it is, that I will in no wise desire the offering of a broken and contrite spirit as it is most pure and without mixture of the creature. For whither there be prophecies, divine openings or revelation, joying or rejoicing in the Holy Ghost, gifts of healing or tongue of utterance, in all these self can rejoice and have a share, being obvious to it and bring it honor. Then said I, Lord, dispense to me what is most pleasing to thee and best for my soul, so long as my weak patience and faith can endure. And when I am ready to faint give me a little of the wine well refined on the lees that my soul may rejoice in the God of my salvation.</p>

I think I never seen Friends part in such a tender solid affectionate loving manner before.

We seemed to have oftentimes scarce time to take a little refreshment between adjournments. There was much weighty business came before this meeting and Friends were favored with ability to attend to it and go through it with propriety, clearness and demonstreration [sic]. I thought I was loaded with a large share of the business, being nominated on every committee I think except two or three viz: on the treasurers accounts and on the epistles. Some

I thought things seemed low at first but growed better. <persName key="w6p953wx">Nathan Smith</persName> and <persName key="w6x16z80">John Reeves</persName> was there and had good service and I had a share with them to good satisfaction and I believe the meeting ended solid and well concurring testimonies were given in concerning this faithful devoted servant of the Lord who seemed to have done his days work and died in a good old age and gathered like a shock of corn in its season.<note type="editorial">Job 5:26</note></p>
<p>He told me this last First Day that when he returned from his last journey of above 400 miles into Virginia and Pennsylvania that when he set his foot on the Jersey shore it felt to him as if he had done with or nearly done with his native land but the prospect of visiting England or the European nations had scarcely been out of his mind in his last journey. And I observe it is no rare or uncommon thing for such Friends to be released and taken away under such prospect, and a lesson of deep instruction and humility there is in such instances. This our dear friend died very suddenly. Having been at work in the field very early in the morning, came to the house, washed himself and lay down and told his wife he felt a pain at his breast and was dead in the space of five or six minutes after he came in without further complaint or struggle, but after he lay down went off and lay as if he had gone to sleep.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1798-08-05"><dateline><date when="1798-08-05">5 of the Month was First Day.</date></dateline><p> This last week I have read <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans'</persName> journal, that part through three summers in which he visited New England, Nova Scotia, Canada, Otego, Genesee Country and the Indian Nations at Stockbridge, Tuskarrow, Oneida etc. and his journey to Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee Country, Virginia and Redstone and this last summer again to the Yearly Meeting at Blackwater in Virginia and through Pennsylvania. I went to see him next day after he got home as I noted a little back.</p>
<p>This summer I been reading the works of that eminent servant of the Lord, Isaac Penington, first volume, see page 602: concerning love question. What is love?</p>
<p>Answer: What shall I say of it, or how shall I in words express its nature? It is the sweetness of life. It is the sweet, tender, melting nature of God, flowing up through his seed of life into the creature and of all things making creature most like unto himself, both in nature and operation. It fulfils the law, it fulfils the gospel, it wraps up all in one and brings forth all in the oneness. It excludes all evil out of the heart; it perfects all good in the heart. A touch of love doth this in measure: perfect love doth this in fullness. But how can I proceed to speak of it! O that the souls of all that fear and wait on the Lord might feel its nature fully; and then would they not fail of its sweet overcoming operations, both towards one another and towards enemies. The great healing, the great conquest, the great salvation is reserved for the full manifestation of the love of God. His judgments, his cuttings, his hewings by the word of his mouth are but to prepare for, but not to do the great work of raising up the sweet build of his life, which is to be done in love and in peace and by the power thereof, and this my soul waits and cries after. Even the full springing up of love in my heart and in the swallowing of me wholly into it and the bringing of my soul wholly forth in it that the life of God in its own perfect sweetness may freely run forth through this vessel, and not be at all tinctured by the vessel, but perfectly tincture and change the vessel into its own nature. And then shall no faults be found in my soul before the Lord but the spotless life be fully enjoyed by me and become a perfectly pleasant sacrifice to my God.</p>
<p>O! How sweet is love! How pleasant is its nature! How takingly doth it behave its self in every condition, upon every occasion, to every person and about everything! How tenderly, how readily doth it help and serve the meanest! How patiently, how meekly doth it bear all things, either from God or man, how unexpectedly so ever they come, or how hard so ever they seem. How doth it believe. How doth it hope. How doth it excuse, how doth cover that which seemeth not to be excusable and not fit to be covered! How kind is it even in its interpretations and changes concerning miscarriages! It never over-chargeth, it never grates upon the spirit of him whom it reprehends. It never hardens, it never provokes but carrieth a meltingness and power of conviction with it. This is the nature of God. This in the vessels capacitated to receive and bring it forth in its glory. The power of enmity is not able to stand against but falls before and is overcome by [it].</p></div>

Last week when at town I was very much taken up early and late, some times till ten at night: but I was favored with good company. lodged with <persName key="w63g5dz0">John Parrish</persName>, <persName key="w68m543d">John Simpson</persName>, and <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> whose company was very edifying.</p>
<p><persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> was mentioning some of Abraham Gibbins words after being at the Yearly Meeting, when it was adjourned when the yellow fever greatly raged. They were speaking of the danger of going to town at that time. A. Gibbins said he had seen a state wherein death was no more terror than to put off one suit of clothes and put on another. And in 1797, when the fever was very mortal at the lower end of the town I was with him at J. James's and he said he found he could not have peace in staying at home and he concluded it was better to come to the Yearly Meeting and die in peace than to stay at home without peace, and that life was not worth having without peace.</p>
<p>This conversation brought to my mind some expressions of <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> as we were going up Haddonfield Hill to meeting, he expecting to embark soon on a religious visit to Europe. I queried with him if he was not afraid to go to sea. He answered that there was something awful in it, but said when the mind has passed through the necessary baptism there was not much for the fear of dead to lay hold of. He died in England of the small pox.</p>

<p>A book giving an account of the first settling of New England mentions a time of great sickness amongst the Indians there. Dinah Milop, an old Indian doctoress, lately informs us of a time of great sickness amongst the Indians as she heard her mother relate and by account something like the sickness in Philadelphia, very mortal so as it seemed as all would be swept off. In conversation with Hannah French this week (upwards of 80 years of age), she said she remembered hearing her father tell of a great sickness amongst the Indians wherein it was said they died about like rotten sheep and one instance in particular an Indian woman was found dead on the road and a child sucking at her breast.</p>
<p>First Day afternoon a note of some expression of a minister preserved by <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty</persName> in his <title>Diary</title>, page 280-1. <q>What a beggarly contemptible thing would it be for any who through laziness of pride would not dig or work for themselves. To be lounging about the doors of the rich, and depend on them for food! If this be a pitiful and contemptible situation in a temporal relation, see whither it be not that of several of yours in a spiritual. Even you who by your gestures manifest an uneasy expectation of being fed with words, whilst you will not beg of God himself as you ought to do with prostrated souls.</q></p>
<p>In <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty's</persName> <title>Spiritual Diary</title> I find this note, page 173, taken I believe out of the book above mentioned giving an account of a work of grace amongst the Indians in New England: J. Eliot in New England translated the Bible and other books into the Indian language, having learnt the language with this God-like view, by whose means Indian churches were established and supplied with Indian preachers and Indian elders. Same book Rutty says, page 163, a curious history: several Indians in America convinced of the fall and restoration of man, and of the inward manifestation of Christ and of the profit of silent worship.<note type="editorial">John Rutty, A Spiritual Diary, and Soliloquies.

<p>See the <title>Life and Posthumous Works</title> of <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge</persName>, page 316, His faithful testifying against the general covetousness in 1720. We are now come to the remarkable year 1720, a time [at] which it becomes us to be humbled in the remembrance of a day of trial, when the love of money and the tempting bait of profit adhered multitudes both of this and other nations into an inordinate imprudent pursuit of it. But though too many of even the professors of the truth itself were prevailed upon by the popular temptations, yet some were preserved from and enabled to testify against the general corruption, among whom it were in justice not to mention him, <persName key="w6wf3zbk">R. Claridge</persName>. He was concerned at that time to bear a zealous and fervent testimony in the public assemblies, full of scriptural exhortations against the sin of covetousness [sic], shewing
<pb n="087" facs="sc203794"/>
shewing the inconsistency of such an extravagant pursuit of the uncertainties of this world as was then practiced, with that self denial and contentment which it becomes a Christian to be found in. Nor was he wanting privately to admonish such particular persons of his acquaintance as he thought a timely caution might be useful to.</p>
<p>Had the faithful exhortation of him and some other worthies in Israel been duly regarded, the professors of truth would not have mixed themselves with worldly minded men nor have partaken of the dishonor and disappointment that ensued.</p></div>

<p>See Rutty's <title>Diary</title>, page 28, a charming account of the five Indian nations in America supported and maintained by principles of honor and not profit in the <title>London Magazine</title>, February 1755. Those Indians have one notable instance of dominion over appetite, viz. they have all kinds of food in equal esteem, deeming it womanish to have any delicacy in the choice of food. Here they surpass us, though some little barbarity sometimes prevails among them. But surely in this and other cases the heathens shall rise in judgment against us Christians (and may I not add) the language of whose conduct is <q>what shall we eat?</q> <q>what shall we drink?</q> and <q>where with shall we be clothed?</q>.<note type="editorial">Matthew 6:31</note> We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel, only let us be called by thy name<note type="editorial">Isaiah 4:1.</note> See <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn's</persName> <title>No Cross No Crown,</title> page 145, Chapter XIII, on covetousness or avarice, <persName key="w63j7f09">Peter Charron's</persName> testimony against it and Abraham Cowley's etc.<note type="editorial"><persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName>, No Cross, No Crown, Part, Chapter 13.

<p>D.H. informed me that the drought was such that it was thought there would not be above one good ear of corn on four hills in places in their part in New England and that the people knew not what to do with their cattle, not having provender for winter nor grass to fat them at present, and I am told pretty straight and clear that last season in Sussex County the covering of straw was taken off some barns for fodder and that many died for want.

London: James Phillips, 1796.</note> concerning Dorothy Owen. The sweet savor of her zealous humble meek example and her dedication of time faculties and property (though in low circumstances) to the glory of God and the good of her fellow creatures had a powerful tendency to enforce the doctrine she preached. She was remarkable for her diligence in the attendance of meetings for worship and discipline from which neither distance nor weather kept her back: while of ability and she frequently went near forty miles on foot in that mountainous country to attend the monthly meeting even when the inclemency of weather rendered it not only difficult but dangerous.
<pb n="101" facs="sc203808"/>
She contented herself with the least expensive manner of living and dress, in order to have the more to distribute to the necessities of others. Tenderly sympathizing with the poor inhabitants around her and so bright was her example that one not in profession with us declared her conduct preaches daily to me.</p>
<p>Her last illness was lingering and painful which she bore with exemplary patience and was eminently favored with divine peace so as sensibly to gather the minds of those who visited her, into a sense of the same blessed influence. Her prospect of future happiness was unclouded, and she said very near the conclusion the arms of divine mercy are wide open to receive me, aged 42 years a minister 19. Same book page 174 Sarah Tailor's words. I was never more sensible than in this time of my confinement and separation from my friends of the various ways in which the Lord's work is marred and his merciful design with respect to individuals frustrated, through the reluctance of the creature to become as passive clay in the hands of the potter vessels of the Lord's own forming without any mixture. Some hesitate some are too forward but all this is from unreduced self and all tends to mar the Lord's work. We are to be formed into pure vessels, quite emptied that the divine word may have free course. No hesitation no activity or contrivance or the creature to choose or refuse etc. etc. and in page 182 she says after expression of suffering on account of deliberating too long in some large meetings and thereby increased here own portion of sorrow and conflict: and the cause suffered and the circulation of life obstructed etc. She says O what an awful thing is [Inserted above: here] gospel ministry. How few understand or are sufficiently baptized into the true nature and spirit of pure living gospel ministry.
