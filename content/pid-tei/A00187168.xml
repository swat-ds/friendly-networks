            <p>
            Having a near sympathizing feeling with thee when I consider of thy lonesome situation without <rs key="w6c82qz0">thy dear husband</rs>, he being called from thee and the rest of his connections in life to go hether and thether to visit the churches of Christ I trust in the love of the gospel and feeling my heart at this time filled with desires for the welfare of my friends everywhere and love unfeigned towards my fellow creatures which extended in a particular manner to thee though unknown to me any other way than a near feeling I have with thee at this time in the truth that is most precious of all other things which alone cements the hearts of the Lordâ€™s children together though far separated in body and under a sense of which I was made willing to take pen in hand with no other desire nor intention than to afford thee some consolation relative to thy companion and now I may inform thee that he in the course of his religious visit came to our parts which is remote and but a small monthly meeting and after visiting the meetings he was drawn to visit families and I was made willing to join with him which occasioned our being considerable together and I may say for thy comfort that I had good unity with him and though the labor was exercising, we were favored to get through I believe to good satisfaction but the praise belongs to the Lord alone, the giver of every good and perfect <add>gift</add>. Now I may inform thee that he was in good health and what I earnestly desire of thee my friend is that thee may endeavor to be content and rely on that arm that is able to preserve thee and to carry him through whethersoever he pleased to lead him and to favor him to return to thee as with shears in his bosom to his and thy great consolation and comfort which that it may be the case is my sincere desire

            I felt a freedom in me just to inform thee <damage><supplied>that</supplied></damage> the labor of <rs key="w6c82qz0">thy dear husband</rs> both at meetings and at several family visits which I was at with him was very affecting to me which I believe will not be soon forgotten and I am in hopes <del>that</del> that I may so steer my course as that it may have the desired affect
