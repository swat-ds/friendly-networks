                    Although I have no personal acquaintance with thee yet that which I have contracted with <rs key="w6c82qz0">thy dear husband</rs> has caused me to think much of thee and thy feeble constitution at this time of thy tried separation from so near a friend. But I believe the errand on which he is sent, and cause that he is engaged in, contributes to thy comfort as well as increases thy solicitude for his preservation. I have been at about thirty eight meetings with him which have generally been larger than usual on such occasions, and very solid, and, I thin<damage><supplied>k</supplied></damage> I may say, satisfactory. It is with a degree of thankfulness to the Father of Mercies that <add>I say</add> his appearance has not been in <add>the</add> way of Friends in this part of the continent as far as I have discovered
                </p>
                <p>
                When it was mentioned in our yearly meeting that his companion expected to return, I felt a desire to accompany him through this part of the country and as far east as he should go, yet was fearful of being in the way of one more suitable, but thought it safest to mention it to a few Friends, and have had cause to rejoice many times since that he condescended to accept my company. If such powerful truths which he has through divine aid had to communicate to us wherever we have been does not awaken us to a more fervent zeal for the promotion of truth by the improvement of our own talents, I have been ready to think that nothing short of the Lord’s taking us in his own hand will effect the purpose of our creation.

                <rs key="w67m1bxt">My beloved husband</rs>, having sent the foregoing, from Boston, for me to forward, unsealed; I could not forbear <add>my</add> dear friend expressing my near sympathy with thou in this thy present allotment; &amp; have before attempted it, but feeling inadequate to the performance of anything that could be acceptable to thou, I with some reluctance threw by my pen at present I think the sympathetic feelings of my mind <del>has</del> is predominant, which induces me to make this <del>little</del> essay, as an additional little testimony on behalf of thy dear husband’s labors amongst us in these parts. Many minds, I believe, have been deeply united, &amp; dipped with him into a sense of the great degeneracy of the present day. &amp; though much revolting &amp; deviation was conspicuous to many of us before, yet indeed I was not aware of the dangerous situation we were in until it was so clearly set forth, both in precept &amp; example, by my much valued &amp; truly beloved friend. &amp; I humbly hope his faithful labors will be measurably blessed and sanctified; that he indeed may have the unspeakably glorious reward of those <quote type="biblical">that turn many to righteousness</quote> <del>which I think</del> though I believe we shall, many of us, have <del>many</del><add>some</add> bitter draughts before we can experience a journeying forward in the line of the divine appointment. I have had many solitary hours, in the absence of my dear husband though favored with <del>many</del> kind friends, yet believing <del>it</del> him to be in the way of duty &amp; having the satisfaction of knowing him to be tenderly beloved by his companion (who is like a nursing father), I have been favored to give him up with more cheerfulness than I could have expected much deserving. It may be the happy means of establishing him upon the immortal foundation towards which he has looked with earnest solicitation in many past seasons; &amp; thereby be enabled to assist my feeble endeavors, if permitted again to enjoy the inestimable favor of his company. I have wrote in haste &amp; hope that thou will excuse the freedom;

                I feel that of a sister towards thee; &amp; was desirous that thou <damage><supplied>should</supplied></damage> know, that the way is made much easier for thy beloved husband than was expected; &amp; I believe that he will be prospered in this important work.
