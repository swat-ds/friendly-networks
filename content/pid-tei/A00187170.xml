                In that love that thinketh no evil but rejoiceth in the truth, do I salute thee, though personally unknown, and inform thee that thy beloved husband <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName>, in in the course of his religious visit to the southern states, was here, and spent several evenings at my house in my lonely situation. Whose company, conversation, and honest deportment was truly acceptable and edifying to me, and I earnestly desire that he may be favored to prosecute his journey to the end, with patience and fortitude, under the many and various dispensations through which he may have to pass; and that he may also be favored, when his service are gone through to return to thee &amp; the rest of his friends at home, with the sheaves of joy and true peace in his own mind, which is the reward of the faithful. I often feel my mind drawn into sympathy with those who are engaged in the cause of truth abroad, and also with their dear companions at home in their absence, which at times may cause trials not easy to be experienced in parting with their near connections in life. Which notwithstanding, it may be in the cross to our own wills, as patience and resignation is abode in. Him who is Israel's Shepherd is witnessed to go with them that go and to stay <add>with them that stay</add>, to their unspeakable comfort and consolation. Which may be thy happy lot, is the prayer of thy sympathizing
