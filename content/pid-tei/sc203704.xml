                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

Weather very warm and we seemed to be overwhelmed with a lethargic stupor far from experiencing anything like sitting together in heavenly places or experiencing the powerful overshadowing of the Holy Ghost among us. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> and divers others able ministers but chiefly shut up or nothing said so as to raise the life in the meeting.</p></div>

I know not any people that can and do make such a show. We read he gave them their heart's desire but sent leanness into their souls.<note type="editorial">Psalm 106:15</note> and leanness poverty, death and barrenness did abound. Simon Gillum said considerable but in a complaining way. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> quite shut up. We had the extracts read from the Yearly Meeting and the report of the Yearly Meeting committee both plentifully complaining of the weak, poor, low state of religion in many places. There were a number of ministers from different quarters and at last, divers lively, savory sentences dropped and I had some share amongst them to right good satisfaction and I thought it ended with a degree of the ownings of truth and savor of life – our worthy progenitors say Barclay and Penn: I think to this effects that churches nor assemblies councils nor synods can do nothing only whilst and when they keep under the guidance and influence of the right spirit: is there not great room to fear very many are sat down at the halfway house and taken up their residence at the town of morality quite contented with a life of morality without aiming to get to the city of the saints solemnity and heaven to themselves cisterns that can hold no water<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:13</note>: and worship the works of their own hands that which their own fingers have made<note type="editorial">Isaiah 2:8</note> A very dull drowsy time with many.</p></div>

The gardens and fields begin to be pinched with dry weather.</p></div>

At our meeting and quite silent as there is five of us who frequently have something to say it is but seldom we have quite a silent meeting and I have been very jealous too seldom. There are two sorts of meetings and two sorts of silent meetings. One sort is the best of all sorts as <persName key="w6q061bh">Stephen Crisp</persName> says to have communion with God is something beyond all declarations or words in which there is no need of words. Repeatedly have I endeavored to point out this best of all sorts of meetings, but the will of the creature and his contrivance will not do neither in silence nor speaking; but acceptable worship is performed in true resignation and obedience as William Dewberry says it is in the will and contrivance of man all the mischief is hatched and as the prophet said they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web he that eateth their eggs dieth that which is crushed breaks out into a viper and as we read so they lap it up.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 59:5</note> <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn</persName> says the good condition of the sheep praises the pasture more than words can do. David says he leadeth me by the still waters and into green pastures.<note type="editorial">Psalm 23:2</note> But oh what is our condition and the state of religion amongst us: oh my leanness my leanness was the language of one of old and how many may adopt it in these days notwithstanding so much labor line upon line and precept upon precept not only here a little and there a little.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 28:10</note> but here a great deal and there a great deal which we acknowledge to be very good. But alas, what hath it done for us is there any growth in vital religion among us so that I have thought of the lamentation over Jerusalem oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings but ye would not<note type="editorial">Luke 13:34</note> and of the woe pronounced against Chorazin: woe unto the Chorazin woe unto the Bethsaida if the great and mighty works which have been done in the had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes<note type="editorial">Matthew 11:21</note> Some of our foremost I find are jealous that things will not always go on so but a time of trial an awakening, trying time will be permitted when poor, dry form only will not do any longer: labor not for the bread that perisheth but for that bread that nourisheth the soul up unto eternal life<note type="editorial">John 6:27</note> and again take no thought wherewithal shall be clothed<note type="editorial">Matthew 6:31</note>: But I thought if there was no more thought for the body than there is for the soul what would be our condition.</p></div>

Although I had wearied myself too much before meeting I was favored to get over a spirit of heaviness and it ended to a good degree of satisfaction. preparative meeting.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1822-06-23"><dateline><date when="1822-06-23">23.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I was reading <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman's</persName> <title>Works</title>, see page 405. John Gratton in his journal, page 45, said the Lord is my portion I shall not want, he hath wrought all my works in me I am nothing but what I am in him. Next is an account of Gilbert Latey oh what a blessed state and glorious attainments did these servants of the Lord through the depths of self denial attain to – oh what poor dwarfs are we compared with them. But see the works of John Hoyland on the prophecies. See what misery ruin and destruction many nations, countries and cities brought on themselves for want of keeping humble and giving way to pride as <persName key="w65q5g7f">Samuel Fothergill</persName> says pride has been the downfall of the greatest cities, empires and kingdoms that ever were erected in the world one reformation after another hath it destroyed: How many besides the city of Sodom, Tyre and Sidon do the Scriptures give accounts of land in utter ruins and desolation. See Hoyland's 2 volume, page 97, they shall destroy the wall of Tyrus and break down her towers such hath been the fate of this once the most famous city in the world for trade and commerce on which this observation may be made: neither kingdoms nor commonwealths, neither public companies nor private persons can long carry on a beneficial flourishing trade without virtue and what virtue teacheth: sobriety, industry, frugality, modesty honesty, punctuality, humanity, charity, the love of our country and the fear of God – But see 1st volume, page 97, the blessed state of the righteous. No evil shall befall those who make the Lord their refuge and the most high their habitation. Neither shall any plague come nigh their habitation or dwelling: They need not fear the wreck of nature nor the crush of worlds: so it seem to read Job 5 and 15 verse and of Daniel and Shadreck, Mescheck and Abednego.<note type="editorial">Daniel 3 and 6</note> Went to our meeting. <persName key="w6ht6kfw">Sarah Cresson</persName> was there and preached till about 1 o'clock in a very sweet manner. Sung many to sleep as one prophesied there should be powerful preacher and dull hearers. Good sermons should be as music to a sleepy man and so it seems to be no tenderness, no contrition, no tears, but far from that dullness and drowsiness covered many: as if they was hearing a pleasant song of a pleasant voice.</p>
<pb n="005" facs="sc204103"/>
<p>This 23 of the Sixth Month. After meeting <persName key="w6ht6kfw">Sarah Cresson</persName> and her brother Samuel and his wife and Samuel Church and wife and <persName key="w6k6603s">David Roberts</persName> and his wife, she is my brother <persName key="w6n05cnp">Joshua's</persName> daughter, came to see us although I am so poorly today that I can hardly keep up or enjoy my friends' company. After tea we dropped into silence as Clarkson says our first Friends often did inadvertently when no one proposed it. So it was with us and Sarah did preach most sweetly a considerable time: since she has been restored from that most deplorable state of despondency. She is much more large and clear in her testimony than ever: restore me to the joy of thy salvation and uphold me by thy free spirit said David<note type="editorial">Psalm 51:12</note> she behaves most beautifully now: no behavior like that truth teaches I hope it was better than spending our time in talking and walking after things that do not profit<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:8</note> which do not afford comfort, peace, and hope to reflect upon.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1822-06-26"><dateline><date when="1822-06-26">Third Day morning.</date></dateline><p> See Hoyland's 2 volume, page 379 no system of government however excellent in its fabric can possess any great measure of duration without that powerful cement, virtue, in the manners and principles of the people – the love of our country and the desire for its rational liberty are noble, virtuous feelings: but there is not any term which has been more prostituted than the word liberty. This day I went to my son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName> to get my wagon mended and this passage accompanied my mind sweetly see Ecclesiastes 9 chapter and 7 verse: go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepteth thy works one would wonder all the world do not hunger and thirst after righteousness – seeing there are so many precious blessings and promises recorded in Scripture for them: from the utmost parts of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous they can say mercy and truth have met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other: truth is sprung out of the earth and righteousness looks down from Heaven,<note type="editorial">Psalm 85:10-11</note> bread shall be given them their waters shall be sure<note type="editorial">Isaiah 33:16</note> the Lord is my portion I shall not want said John Gratton he hath wrought all my works in me<note type="editorial">Isaiah 26:12</note> I am nothing but what I am in him again. It is said the angel of the Lord encampeth round about the righteous, and saveth them.<note type="editorial">Psalm 34:7</note> but Paul tells how it fared with the wicked there and twenty thousand fall in one day<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 10:8</note> and it is said the angel of the Lord is one night slew one hundred and four score and five thousand in one night for their wickedness<note type="editorial">Isaiah 37:36</note></p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1822-06-27"><dateline><date when="1822-06-27">Fourth Day morning.</date></dateline><p> Very like for rain.</p>
<p>As I remarked before, 23 of the Sixth Month, First Day, <persName key="w6ht6kfw">Sarah Cresson</persName> was at our meeting and had a great deal to say I thought the states of the people or many of them was opened to my view but no time nor opening to mention it yet it illustrated and spread until it was an instructing lesson on to me: it appeared that many were like Martha who Christ said was careful about many things and too few like minded with Mary who had chosen the good part that should never be taken from her,<note type="editorial">Luke 10:41-2</note>; and some were like Achan and Gehazi<note type="editorial">2 Kings 1:20-27</note> coveting the golden wedge and the Babylonish garment<note type="editorial">Joshua 7:21</note>; and many were like Demas who had embraced this present world<note type="editorial">2 Timothy 4:10</note> which is enmity with true religion. Some had made gold their hope and the fine gold their confidence; many had placed their affliction on things below and not on things above and direful has been the consequence of desires misplaced and like causes will always produce like effects. Many things indeed we poor mortals are very careful and busy about whilst the one thing needful is neglected, not considering how soon these many things which assume a mighty great importance and demand all our attention – may and must soon leave us or we must leave them as we see many do in the midst of their carrier as the man we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully and he concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years but it was said to him thou fool this night shall thy soul be required of thee and then whose shall these things be which thou hast provided. And so shall it be with all those who lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God.<note type="editorial">Luke 12:19-21</note> and again it is said as a partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and in the end become a fool<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 17:11</note> and so I have seen it to be in many instances and how very different has their latter end been from those who like Mary who had chosen the good part that should never be taken from her<note type="editorial">Luke 10:42</note> or like David who so earnestly desired to be led in the way everlasting<note type="editorial">Psalm 139:24</note> As I have heard from some who had embraced this present world and set their minds on things below, one said if I had my time to live over again it should not be as it has been; another said I have been careful to pay everyone his due and I have frequented religious meetings but as to the great business the great work of my souls salvation, I have never done so much as move the least grain of sand; another said at last now I must go and oh that I might go in peace; and many more like these who were counted good moralists but had been careful about many things and neglected the lone thing needful, seeking acceptance with their Maker.</p>
<pb n="011" facs="sc204105"/>
<p>Seeking acceptance with our Maker is not that the one thing needful above all others and the only way that is lasting as David calls it the way everlasting, but for want of such in after this one thing needful this way everlasting and choosing the good part as Mary did. Oh to see and think what a most miserable, unhappy like very many live wearying out their days with sorrow, misery, and affliction; but oh the blessed and happy state of those who seek after the one thing needful acceptance with their Maker: see Ecclesiastes 9 and 7 go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for God now accepth thy works. Here indeed is experienced that saying that prosperity is redoubled to a good man for what joys or pleasures, riches, or treasure (of this world) can equal a secret sense of acceptance with God who alone could say and can say neither grace nor glory nor any good thing shall be withheld from them that seek first the Kingdom of God and the righteousness thereof (the one thing the most needful) all things needful shall be added. Job says when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me because I deliver the poor that cried and him that had none to help him: the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon one and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame I was a father to the poor and the cause which I knew not I searched out: they will<note type="editorial">Job 29:11-16</note> – the righteous flourish like a tree planted by the rivers of water. And is not this the way everlasting the way to live to purpose to the greatest and most noble and most glorious of purposes without which to what purpose do we live.</p>
<p>To man in a savage, uncultivated state the earth is an abode of desolation where shelter is insufficient and even food precarious see Hoyland's first volume page 46, see the sentence above bountiful as is the hand of providence his gifts are not so bestowed as to seduce us into idleness but are calculated to rouse exertion.</p></div>

I sat off early and went to see <persName key="w61h1brp">Job Cole's</persName> wife in a very weak, low, poor state of health; seems almost worn away to skin and bone although she has been a very fat corpulent body. She is so weak she cannot bear but little company. Then I went to Haddonfield to see my old acquaintance Kester Laning a poor old widow who has been blind near twenty years now almost worn away, aged 83; they expressed gladness in the visit. Then I went to Haddonfield meeting which was but small and a zeal for religion very low, yet it was through unmerited mercy the most open, owning time I ever had there till near one o' clock and when we came out we were favored with that precious cement: openness, sweetness, kindness, and feeling nearness, hearty, inviting, kindness all new after meeting. I went to see another poor, ancient widow almost worn away to skin and bone; both these last upwards of eighty and one maintained by our meeting. Last Fifth Day I went to see <persName key="w6mt4j9v">Joseph Cowperthwaite</persName> near 30 years of age he has been in a wasting, declining state of health his several years but now reduced to almost skin and bone I got well home but was very much wearied when I got from Haddonfield.</p>
    <p>I read the news but little and really I am afraid of them:<note type="editorial">i.e., newspapers</note> they come to the house as reaping papers. I picked up one the other day I think it is said 36 died in one week with the consumption in the City of New York and also in Philadelphia many die with it.</p></div>

Miserable folly indeed to devote all their time strength and talents: in providing for the body which is but of a few days and full of trouble and to neglect that of laying up treasures for eternity seriously to think of it what weakness and folly appears.</p>

She attained to the station of a reputable, acceptable minister and traveled considerable abroad and in particular that of visiting families.

<p>I have often thought what very desirable things wisdom and riches are amongst men: that there are according to Scripture two sorts of wisdom and two sorts of riches: the wisdom that is from above is said to be pure, peaceable, and gentle and easy to be entreated and devilish.<note type="editorial">James 3:15-17</note> – one sort of riches is called in Scripture the true riches, durable riches, etc.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 8:18</note> But Solomon says there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 13:7</note> Is it wisdom in men of understanding to set their hearts and minds and affections on things below taking more cost and pains to lay up treasures on earth which can be enjoyed for a very little while: than Heavenly treasures would cost them as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, Oh, the baseness and meanness of those spirits, spirits that despises or neglect the joys and glories of immortality for the things that are seen, which are but temporal, debasing the nobility of their souls, abandoning the government of this Divine Spirit, and embracing with all ardency the sensual pleasures of this life but such as persevere therein shall never enter into God's rest.

<p>I was once with a sick man near the solemn close and he was counted a wise man and his language was oh this world, this world, it is the merest cheat and how many millions have been undone and cheated by it since the days of Balaam who it is said loved the wags of unrighteousness.<note type="editorial">2 Peter 2:15</note> and like Achan and Gehazi<note type="editorial">2 Kings 1:20-27</note> who coveted the golden wedg and Babylonish garment<note type="editorial">Joshua 7:21</note> and like Demas who abandoned the Lord's cause and the government of the Divine spirit<note type="editorial">2 Timothy 4:10</note> or like Judas who sold his master for 30 pieces of silver and was his own executioner for he went out and hanged himself<note type="editorial">Matthew 27:5</note> It appeared to me this afternoon as a matter of wonder that so many thousands and millions of people should be so much like Martha of old careful about many things and so neglect the one thing needful the good part which Mary chose and Christ said should never be taken from her.<note type="editorial">Luke 10:41-42</note>; especially when I consider how evidently it is demonstrated in numberless numbers of things and instances the wisdom there is above all things, to save up for ourselves treasures in Heaven, and on the other hand the unspeakable folly in neglecting it. To take this subject into serious consideration, the desire people have to obtain riches and wisdom would open a large field for consideration, meditation, and contemplation. But in short what a blessed thing it would be if all people would make choice of that riches which is durable and of that wisdom which is profitable to direct whereby the frowned and the disobedient are turned to the wisdom of the just: see Psalms 73, 22 verse: So foolish was I and ignorant I was as a beast; before thee some have compared the state of the worldly minded man to the state of Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a beast's heart was given him<note type="editorial">Daniel 4:33</note>; be ye not like the horse or as the mule that hath no understanding said David<note type="editorial">Psalm 32:9</note>; no sight or sense taste nor feeling or desires after Heavenly treasures oh earth earth hear oh earth etc<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 22:29</note> Nothing like the state and disposition David felt when he said as the heart panteth after the water brooks so doth my soul after thee O Lord.<note type="editorial">Psalm 42:1</note> etc.; and again he says let my right hand forget her cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth and if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chiefest joys<note type="editorial">Psalm 137:5-6</note>; and again see the command from highest authority if thy right hand offend thee cut it off or if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out<note type="editorial">Matthew 5:29-30</note>; is not the state of those who have set their affections on things below very different from this; did Moses make a foolish choice when he refused the riches and honors of Pharaoh's court and chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season: a short season<note type="editorial">Hebrews 11:25-26</note></p>

<p>See <supplied><persName key="w66696rh">Lindley Murray's</persName></supplied> <title>Power of Religion on the Mind</title> by John Gough, page 70: the continual troubles and discomposures, sickness and calamities that attend our lives, the shortness and continued vexations occurring in them, and finally the common examples of death and mortality of all ages and sexes and conditions of mankind are sufficient instruction to convince reasonable men who have the seriousness and patience to consider and observe that we have no abiding city here and on the other side. If we will but give ourselves leisure to consider the great wisdom of almighty God who orders everything in the world to ends suitable and proportionable, the excellency of the soul and mind of man, the great advances and improvements his nature is capable of, the admirable means which the merciful wise God hath afforded mankind by his works of nature and providence by his word and instruments to qualify him for a nobler life than this world below can yield. We shall readily confess that there is another state, another city to come: which it becomes every good and wise and considerate man to look after and fit himself for and yet if we look up on the generosity of mankind with a due consideration they will appear to be like a company of distempered people; the greatest part of them make it their whole business to provide for a rest and happiness in this world. They make these vain of acquests wealth and honor, the preferments of this world their great if not their only business and happiness: and which is yet a higher degree of frenzy; they esteem this the only wisdom and judge the careful provision for eternity the folly of a few weak, melancholy, fanciful men. Where was it is a truth and in due time it will evidently appear that those men who are most solicitous for the attaining of their everlasting rest are the only truly wise men and so shall be acknowledged by those that now despise them – we fools counted his life madness and his end to be without honor how is he numbered among the children of God and his lot among the saints.</p></div>

As to the grounding of youth in true religion and saving faith: for nothing short of the work of grace in the heart, the new birth, and the washing of regeneration by the word can make a sound right Christian and a true minister. Tertullian used to say if people depart from the discipline of the cross they cease among us to be called Christian but if that was our rule how many would it divest of that noble title in our days, how many millions are great stranger to this sort of talk about the work of grace or the new birth who concludes: they are very good Christians without understanding

Yet how many of these who have obtained a character amongst men and made it their chief concern to accumulate wealth and lay up treasures on earth and could say at last when they were just about to launch into the unknown regions of eternity, they had goods laid up in store for many years yet like the foolish virgins no oil in their lamps.<note type="editorial">Matthew 25:1-3</note> And this was the language of one who bore the character of a moral honest man and no one could say anything against him, only he was too greedy after the world and his last words were oh darkness darkness darkness and so died away another very innocent, hard working, worldly-minded, money-getting man. At last said now I must go and oh that I might go in peace and they have preserved the words of another moral man in good credit amongst his neighbors but had not been enough – concerned shew himself approved in the sight of God then thousands of worlds would not tempt me to live in the world as I have done again another as I have heard ten thousands of worlds would I now give if it was in my power for peace with the Lord.

It was not only small but very poor, dull, and drowsy waters too low to attempt to go a step. We have many things that call for our care and attention for both soul and body the call of the Lord is gone forth as in days of old after divers ways and divers manners but it appears the world's calls outbids all, but how will that do when every source and prop of earthly comfort fails, which they surely will sooner or later. And we see they often do in many instances all round us daily, see James 4 and 4 the friendship of this world is enmity to God. Not all the persecutors and open apostates that ever rose up against us ever has done us that hurt as prosperity has done said one of our worthy progenitors; another in my hearing said that the unlawful love of lawful things was the greatest snare ever the Devil had to catch Quakers. As <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> expresses it a more subtle crafty snare the crafty Devil never had to catch people than the allurements of this world so earthly mindedness brings darkness, feebleness, weakness so many meetings have grown weakly and sickly and so have dwindled, withered, and died away and their meetings have dropped and their meeting houses left desolate, a habitation for the little owls, the moles and the bats, as I have seen to be the case with us after all the labor bestowed upon us; the Lord is with you whilst you be with him if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you said Azariah.<note type="editorial">2 Chronicles 15:2</note> They that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies.<note type="editorial">Jonah 2:8</note> Will not all prove at last lying vanities but the one thing needful, all find out what that is at last; without that all cry vanity.

Oh how destitute of that all powerful preserving Christian principle are innumerable multitudes of dark heathen nations now groaning under gross darkness, idolatry and superstition and what is there that can preserve them from thus destroying, murdering and massacring one another as they do but obedience to that light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. So see here the fruits and effects of the want of obedience. Famine, sword and pestilence sore judgments with which the people have been visited for their wickedness and disobedience in ages and nations past down to these days. Like cases produce like effects – it is a great mercy the Christian religion hath so far prevailed amongst us that we are preserved from such dreadful customs, superstition and idolatry, tumults, bustling outrageous massacring and murdering as we hear and read of amongst the heathen nations in many places where the Christian religion is but little professed and less practiced.</p></div>

It is to be feared these multitudes of people never had very little if any opportunity of acquaintance with that religion that Paul speaks of that had brought him and them in his days to such a blessed and glorious safe and happy state what a lamentable pity it is that people who have the offer and means held out to their acceptance: of acquaintance with that religion which has been such a blessing to thousands and millions innumerable what a pity any should be so unwise like Esau of old not know how to set a price upon and so sell it for a morsel of meat<note type="editorial">Genesis 25:32-34</note>: then at last seek it with tears too late to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent is life eternal and again acquaint now thyself with him and beat peace but oh the estrangedness how little acquainted with that powerful influence of Heavenly goodness that supported and sustained and comforted the martyrs and our first Friends under all their great sufferings and trials.</p></div>

<p>See Lamentations 1 and 9: verse her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end. Therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter.

We hear of these sore judgments on the people of Ireland and New York and many other places but yet how little do we think what a coming down there would be amongst us if the Lord should turn his hand upon us and send some of these sore judgments amongst us how would our shining painted carriages, gilded harness shining like silver, and nice, matched, fine, fat horses looks when we were so starved and hungry as to wish to eat a piece of the fine horses.

The meeting was very large and it is likely many were disappointed for we had but little preaching waters seemed low there were a number of valuable ministers and in the meeting for business answering queries there were many pertinent, lively remarks on the state of society and things amongst us. I expressed some concern I had on account of the growing increasing custom of reading the news and the customary unnecessary unbecoming use of tobacco. The most enormous expense our country was at to furnish themselves with these two articles: the thousands and tens of hundreds of thousands if not millions of money which if applied to the use of the poor would help many a worthy person in distress and would be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord. I expect I exposed myself to the scorn and contempt of many although I have no doubt there is a witness placed in every heart that testifies there is a great excess and danger in them things although so little noticed which would not be pleasant to remember in a time of trouble such as they at this time experience at New York and in Ireland where they are raising money by thousands to keep the poor from starving and they say many perish for want. Our first Friends William Edmondson and <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> bore a zealous testimony against the customary unbecoming use of tobacco to see even boys and girls smoking segars many hurting their health I am informed that the expense in segars one year in the City of New York only was 20 thousand dollars I had peace.</p>

Richard Davies says it was their concern in all their meetings together to feel the Lord among them and he did manifest himself among them at times in a distinguished manner to the contriting their hearts even to tears so that at some of their meetings there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them although altogether silent and they could say the Lord alone was master of their assembly and they used to say when friends minds were more disencumbered with the cares of this world the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was more frequently felt amongst them but alas what do we experience of these things would it not be strange talk do we even understand such language: I have heard tell of the garment of praise – instead of the spirit of heaviness<note type="editorial">Isaiah 61:3</note> but I thought we had the spirit of heavyness instead of the garment of praise I thought I seldom ever seen a duller, poorer time and all shut up till at last E.R. said considerable and it seemed to end a little better but I was unwell and hardly able to wrestle or labor for the arisings of life which it seems very few so much as ever think of or understand the language so no wonder poverty abounds: Last Sixth Day, the 13th, there were 3 burials at Haddonfield: Bulah Clement near 90 years of age my old acquaintance and one stout healthy man In the midst of his days with very short illness. We hear of great sickness at Salem and Woodbury and many deaths and we hear of pinching drought in Bucks County and Chester County fields of corn they say many will yield next to nothing: it has been so dry and hot here that the Indian corn is fit to husk and many are at it I believe the man is not living that ever seen the like it has been very hot weather ill now 18 of the Ninth Month it changed very cool this night a pretty smart frost for the first this fall <persName key="w6n87x9b">Job Scott</persName> in his journal mentions a frost in the Eighth Month which he seem to thing – something alarming but some remarked there was frost almost every month through the summer a few years ago however I know we used sometimes to have the corn killed with the frost before it was ripe.

Page 280: For extraordinary things frequently repeated are extraordinary no longer and consequently soon lose their force is this the reason why in these days line upon line and precept upon precept have so little effect or what is it. Page 281: The man who fears God is raised above all other fear in the confidence of faith: it appears to be so in the case of Daniel, Shadreck and Abednego. Page 282: Unless the mind be under the regulating power of religion it will be perpetually losing its balance and changing its temper in substance he says some times too fast and some times too slow some times too high and some times too low in spirit. Page 285: But we need not recur to distant periods of history for an example of ruin our effects produced by inattention to religious principles the history of every man's own experience is illustration sufficient: but see the stability of the righteous see last part of the 5 of Job thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh so indeed it appears to have been with Daniel, Shadreck, Mashick and Abednego and all the faithful martyrs and our worthy progenitors they could not afright them with their utmost stretch of power to punish with prison nor dungeon, stake, gallows, whipping, or banish men and all their envy and malice could invent page 283 he says of little consequence is it to obtain the possession of expected good unless we are fitted for the enjoyment of it: this makes me think of some of our youth ho after their parents have been at great expense in schooling their children they bring forth sour grapes and what can fit children for the enjoyment of good but as <persName key="w6cg1kgr">John Churchman</persName> says prepare their minds to receive the power of truth without which he says they never can be happy page 284 he says there can be no good government but what is found upon religion: page 292 Happiness consists not in having possessions but in being fitted to enjoy them how have we seen the truth of this saying verified in very many instances where young people have had very great estates put into their hands they have lived very unhappy for want of being fitted to enjoy them and their minds prepared to receive the power of truth without which earthly possessions cannot make them happy: 20 First day I so lame could not go to meeting weather warm like midsummer.

He had been at work at it with four or five hands about ten days and that day was to finish the job but this 27 of the Eleventh Month, 1822, about one o'clock, the bank caved in and covered up one of the men, all but his head and nose and whilst they were digging him out the earth caved in the second time and some ironstone being throwed up on the bank fell in and struck our dear son on the breast and covered him up to the knees. They quickly got him dug loose but he told them he was so hurt he could not live. They carried him to a house near half a mile [and] sent for a doctor. One got there very soon after he was hurt and the second in a short time but his wound was so deep they could do nothing for him and he lived hard four hours after he was hurt. They sent for his wife but he was gone before she got there they tell us he had a great deal to say raised his voice and desired them about him not to put of making preparation for such a time as that was with him and advised his little son William 11 years old to be a good boy said he was concerned for his children and not only for his own but for all the world over and told them his peace was made and had a hope of future happiness. It was believed bleeding inwardly suffocated him and took him of and that might be the reason why he appeared not to be in great misery and pain.</p></div>

<pb n="043" facs="sc204141"/>
<p>In memory of my dear son <persName key="w64v7902">Benjamin Hunt</persName> who was just about forty two years of age when he died: He was a pretty little innocent goodly child from his infancy remarkably beloved by all his little brothers and sisters and all along as he grew up: he seemed to be beloved by all that knew him or had anything to do with him. His servant a coloured lad said he could live with Benne forever. A poor old widow who lived with him as an hired servant said she had lost a good friend. He was industrious enough, ingenious, gifted and very capable of managing his temporal affairs. He had a good share of natural understanding gifts and talents and seemed disposed to improve and make a right use of them he was very constant and diligent in tending all our religious meetings and very exemplary in quiet steady setting in our meetings for worship in the time of silence and sometimes spoke to the business in meetings for discipline which was acceptable to his Friends. His troubles and trials were many and very great which he bore with great fortitude and exemplary patience. Now he is gone we believe out of the reach of trouble where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest: where none of the inhabitants ever shall say I am sick: made his escape, as David says, from the windy – storm and tempest<note type="editorial">Psalm 55:8</note>: for such this world is to very many. As he had lived, so he died, beloved and lamented by his friends and neighbors, few leavening a more unblemished character: which seems now to be a very great advantage to his poor children for it is wonderful to see the open heartedness and kindness of his friends in a care and concern to take care of his dear little children: for whom he expressed such a concern in his last moments and a very great comfort to see a prospect of the children being like to get such good places with their relations where they seem like to be kindly cared for both temporally and spiritually.</p>
<p>It is a grievous thing when some shorten their days with intemperance and leave poor families of children a burden on their friends as some do and nothing but a grief to their friends from their cradles.</p></div>

Without this concern and labor <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> says people may perish for want.  We have line upon line, precept upon precept upon precept not only here a little and there a little but here a great deal and there is a great deal which we acknowledge to be very good but what has it done for us where much is given much will be required woe unto the Corasin woe unto the Bethsaida if the great and mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented long: ago in sackcloth and ashes<note type="editorial">Luke 10:13</note>: Noah was a preacher of righteousness, Moses was a prophet and see what became of the people that they preached to Noah's people all perished in the flood Moses's people all fell in the wilderness but Caleb and Joshua and the people to whom Christ was given were no less perverse and wicked and his instruction were lost upon them and in about the same space of time after they had rejected him they were destroyed: says Hoyland: so see here is the effects and fruits of people sitting down contented with barely hearing tell of good things without laboring to possess them for themselves.</p>
<p>As I lay thinking of the sudden death of our dear son <persName key="w64v7902">Benjamin</persName> it came fresh into remembrance how many times I seemed to narrowly escape being suddenly killed by accidents and how many are or have been very suddenly snatched away without a moment's warning as it were and very many by sickness with very short – warning: so that happy indeed are they that wisely prepare for it and as I had to mentions last First Day was a week the last meeting I and my dear son sat together in meeting: I said I had of ten thoughts what a fine thing it would be if I could be one of the number of the righteous then if I should be suddenly snatched away without a moment's warning as many are yet all would be well. Oh,  how little did he or I think it would so soon be his lot to be so soon and so suddenly snatched away: yet it seems to be generally believed all is well with him: for that transcends all this world can afford when we consider the length of eternity.</p></div>

But a few weeks ago, Isaac Hammer from Tennessee Countery, 600 miles or more from the south west appointed a meeting at Moorestown, but had nothing to say or at least said nothing, and I am informed he was silent at several other neighbouring meetings although he is an able minister, as they profess to be led by an unerring spirit, these things may seem strange to many but the prophet speaking in the name of the Lord said, your ways are not my ways nor your thoughts my thoughts as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts<note type="editorial">Isaiah 55:8-9</note> much cloudy weather and rain but holds fine and warm.</p></div>

He is by some, if not many, counted the greatest minister in America. I scarcely ever seen our meeting House more fully crowded, and he preached one hour or more, very sound pertinent doctrine, and the people were very attentive, but alas, what does it do for us, all the abundance of preaching we have had of latter time. Our first Friends say that in early days, when the people's minds were more disengaged from the world, the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was more frequently and evidently felt amongst them to the tendering their hearts and coveting their spirits even to tears and trembling – but it is to be feared his humble tender contrite state is too little known in these days: If there was a disposition not only to hear and enquire after the right way of the Lord and a desire to walk in it there would be room for hope: but whilst people are determined to walk in their own ways like the gentiles: we will eat our own meat and wear our own apparel, etc..<note type="editorial">Isaiah 4:1</note> It is as <persName key="w6q061bh">Stephen Crisp</persName> says; see his <title>Sermons</title>, page 256: For so long as men and women stand in unity with their lusts and concupiscence with the spirit of this world and the way of it, they are not capable of receiving that which should lead them into the way of Holiness. Nay, if it appears to them they cannot receive it: for it is with them as with other guests. There are other lovers already let in which employ the powers and faculties of their souls. So these celestial showers are like pouring water upon a rock: all runs off without making any impressions, and but little fruit of all the abundance of labor bestowed upon us our first Friends say many were convinced at their meetings, and we read that 3000 were converted at Peter's first sermon and as many as made 5000 at the next. I thought the meeting for discipline was pretty well conducted and the stranger had a good deal to say and it was satisfactory to me. I thought I saw the states of the people and what they stood in need of.</p>

<p>See here some words of <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName>: Blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled: it is the full soul that loathes the honeycomb. Those who are overcharged with the world and the things of the world they are of an ill constitution: they are so filled with the world that they cannot hunger and thirst after righteousness. The Lord fills the hungry with good things but they that are rich and full and think they want nothing, he sends empty away. <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName> says to be cloyed is to lose all: it appears a full fed cloyed state was a very loathsome state to the children of Israel.

Margaret Allison and a young minister from Holly took up some of the time and Daniel stood up the second time and we thought he was favored and the meeting ended reputably savory and well he is a very great preacher and there might be some good done but the tenderness and contrition was but little to what it has been in some meetings the ointment of his right hand betrayeth its self.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 27:16</note> As <persName key="w6md3mdh">Robert Walker</persName> said, people love to hear preaching but they do not love the cross.

At our preparative meeting and I did think we were favored with something quickening, comforting, and lively although the meeting was not larger than common, notwithstanding all the great deal of preaching we have lately had preparative meeting and in a good degree satisfactory: I see no countenances or conduct or deportment marked with any more seriousness or weightiness since these great preachers have been amongst us although some went to hear them that do not go to meeting once in seven years but some countenances were marked with seriousness, sorrow, and sadness with the language of mortality and the death of near connections a just remark – There is a grandeur, a magnanimity, and glory in the primitive Christian character, which nothing on earth can ever equal. In short or in fine the most ample preparation for defense by carnal weapons endangers life and that of peace of mind without which life is of little value, nay, some have said life is not worth having without peace how then can it be purchased too dear: it has been said they can loose but little that save themselves and they who lose peace of mind sustain the greatest loss.</p></div>

<p>See Hoyland's second volume, page 240. No place is frightful to a good man, but the dungeon of a wounded conscience or an evil conscience it is the favor or displeasure of an Almighty judge that makes this or the other place or spot: comfortable or irksome. Where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty, but to the guilty, the whole world is a place of confinement. 24: How much wiser, how much more happy and safe and noble are they who live in communion with God than other men. See Proverbs 28 and 1st: The wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion. See Job 5th, 21 verse: Neither shalt be afraid of destruction when it cometh so indeed it appears to have been with thousands of the martyrs since the days of Daniel and Steven: and see the 91 Psalm 5th: verse Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day etc. read the chapter and see the great displays of Almighty power and wisdom in the destruction of the wicked and also in the preservation and deliverance of the righteous set forth in the 11th of Hebrews: He stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire out of weakness they were made strong waxed valiant in fight and put the armies of the aluns to flight.

<div type="entry" n="1823-03-13"><dateline><date when="1823-03-13">13 of the Third Month.</date></dateline><p> Was our quarterly meeting. John Warring from Long Island a great and worthy minister had very pointed, pertinent service respecting the dull, drowsy, lifeless state of society after him stood up <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> the old standard and almost king of America and he did make all shake and ring again there was another stranger from the Province of Maine. Townsend Hawksworth had good service in the afternoon these appear to be great ministers and I thought in the afternoon these appear to be great ministers and I thought their countenances were marked with seriousness gravity humility and meekness: do we not read there was an inscription of Holiness on all the vessels of the Lord's house [Exodus 39:30]: their faces did not look like the faces of the drunkards: dismal as some have said: some of us thought it was an highly-favored meeting throughout: a concern appeared on account of the loss state of religion by reason of the many deviations amongst old and young.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1823-03-16"><dateline><date when="1823-03-16">16.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting not so bad but it might have been a great deal worse and not so well but it might have been a great deal better if we had not been wanting on our part I hope it ended reputably if it was not crowned as it might have been and some have been.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1823-03-20"><dateline><date when="1823-03-20">20.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. A great snow storm I did not get out to meeting although the children went: I was reading a little in a little geography a school book it seems beyond conception to think of the extent of our continent and the numerous states, towns, islands, and rivers and the numerous inhabitants and it is likely all of them have a religion of some sort and it is to be feared that saying in Scripture yet remains to be true strait is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and peace and few there be that find it<note type="editorial">Matthew 7:14</note>: as the primitive Christians and our worthy progenitors did and the faithful yet do who do experience the promise of Christ to meet with them and that his words are spirit and life and to say with one of old I sat under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste<note type="editorial">Song of Solomon 2:3</note> I sit not to be feared that hundreds of thousands professing religion never come to experience this: yet content with a hope and a peace of some sort: and what is all the profession of religion and the Scripture good for with without acceptance with the Lord is not like feeding on wind as some of old.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1823-03-24"><dateline><date when="1823-03-24">24.</date></dateline><p> on Second Day. At 4 o'clock Townsend Hawksworth of Long Island appointed a meeting at our meeting House it was as large as could be expected. The stranger had a good deal to say but in a complaining way he expressed he found it hard to say any thing amongst us and spoke of the easeful state of many who go and come to meeting in an easy way like the door on the hinges.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1823-03-26"><dateline><date when="1823-03-26">26.</date></dateline><p> A very great northeast storm of snow and rain and cold.</p></div>

See a pamphlet called the <title>Reformer</title> Ninth Month 1st 1821, volume 2nd page 282 an extract. Whoever rebels against the laws of his duty and plainly affronts the dictates of his conscience, does that moment bid adieu to all true repose and quiet and exposes himself to the severest resentments of a self-tormenting mind. And though by secret acts of wickedness he may be able possibly to drown the voice of it for a while, yet every little affliction or petty accident, will be apt to awaken it into horror and let in terror like an armed man upon him. A torment infinitely beyond what the most – ingenious tyrants could ever contrive. Nothing so effectually invades our ease as the reproach of our own minds. The wrath of man may be endured, but the eruptions of conscience are irresistible. The Scriptures say a wounded conscience who can bear – some have compared or called it unquenchable fire and some of the martyrs chose rather to be burnt at the stake than bear that unquenchable fire: the Scriptures say it is not by us to be conceived the good things the Lord hath in store for the – righteous and Addison says it is not in the power of imagination to conceive the direfull state of a wounded conscience to that effect.</p></div>

He has seen much unpleasant things in his day. His wife many years confined to her bed and himself many years confined to his room. I knew his father and mother from early life so we see how soon one generation passes away after another. This day received another letter from my son <persName key="w6vz1749">Joseph</persName>.</p>
<p>One of my friends brought me Samuel Scott's diary to read I had seen it before but it was very acceptable: This week he says has passed pretty comfortably not much cause for condemnation having attended: nevertheless I have fallen short in respect to unnecessary words and thoughts: When we neither act speak or think anything inconsistent with the divine will: this says one is perfect satisfaction: and this is the mark of our high and Holy calling in Christ Jesus who himself was holy harmless, undefiled, and separate from sinners.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1823-04-10"><dateline><date when="1823-04-10">10th of the Fourth Month, 1823.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day I ventured out to meeting though hardly able it was our Monthly Meeting – <persName key="w6ht6kfw">Sarah Cresson</persName> was there and shewed her zeal for the Lord had extensive acceptable service. Humility she said was the true Christian's everyday dress. My mind was impressed at the same time with the same in substance I was viewing the vast importance of true vital religion and the blessed fruits and effects and on the other side the direful fruits and effect where it was suffered to go to decay where people cast off all religious restraint and pursue lying vanities and forsake their own mercies<note type="editorial">Jonah 2:8</note> and the grievous humbling things sorrow of heart and remorse of conscience destruction and dissolation that often overtake poor mortals not only individuals but even whole nation: that which I have planted will I pluck up even this whole nation oh to think of the blessed safe happy glorious state of the primitive Christians but did any either individuals or whole societies of people ever come to experience the precious fruits and effects of true religion without – humility the humble the Lord teaches of his ways and dwells with them but beholds the proud afar off. In the afternoon I thought there was some life and savor to good satisfaction – I dined with <persName key="w6ht6kfw">Sarah Cresson</persName> at Joseph Matlack's – seen an account in the news of the great storm about two weeks ago. I said it would be a terrible time with people on the water and so it is said abundance of vessels on all our coasts great and small and many lives were lost but the destruction amongst the vessels was such as is very seldom heard of the vast number great and small being lost away and wrecked.</p>
<p>Seen a vast large account of what they call a work of grace amongst the Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians. I fear they will fill the world (as <persName key="w6q061bh">Stephen Crisp</persName> says) with a sort of Christians that want acceptance with God. And then what is all the profession of religion in the world good for without his acceptance and <persName key="w6q061bh">S. Crisp</persName> says their doings has been the downfall of Christianity in the present: it is surprising to think of their great inventions – I believe the Devil does not care how much religion people have if they keep clear of humility and the cross.</p></div>
