                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<div type="undetermined"><head><supplied>July 1820</supplied></head><p>Self the greatest deceiver and greatest thief and greatest enemy.</p></div>
    <div type="entry" n="1820-07-14"><dateline><date when="1820-07-14">This morning, 14th of the Seventh Month, 1820</date></dateline><p>, something opened on my mind respecting selfishness or a selfish spirit. See Mark 8th chapter 34 verse: And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them <q>Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me: and glorious the fruits thereof.</q> See Isaiah 28 and 15: and under falsehood have we hid ourselves, and direful the effects. 2 of Timothy, 3 and 2: Men shall be lovers of their own selves, and woeful the effects. A certain writer, I think Fletcher, on self knowledge says: Of all imposters, self-deception is the greatest. See <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman's</persName> <title>Caution to the Rich</title>, page 43: holding treasure in the self-pleasing spirit is a strong plant, the fruit whereof ripens fast. A day of outward distress is coming, and divine love calls to prepare against it. Again, see <persName key="w6wr0v4m">J. Woolman</persName>, page 37, to the rich: when our eyes are so single as to discern the selfish spirit clearly, we behold it the greatest of all tyrants. So he considers and concludes that all the persecutions and dreadful oppression of the African race and all the destructive desolating wars as the effects and fruits of a selfish spirit, far surpassing all the power of the greatest tyrants.</p>
<p><persName key="w6kf2phb">Thomas Chalkley</persName>, I think, calls it cursed self. And as Alice Hays and <persName key="w6086z81">Benjamin Lay</persName> says, a selfish spirit is Satan's spirit. Thomas à Kempis says: know that thy own self, thy own will, hath done thee more hurt than any thing in the world, or to that effect. <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> remarks in <title>Carver's Travels</title> many thousands of miles amongst the Indians, says there is no greater or more severe reflection or stigma or reproach amongst the Indians than to say of anyone, <q>he loves himself.</q> No doubt they did see what the fruits and effects of that selfish spirit would be if suffered to grow amongst them and how contrary it was to that open, free universal spirit that breathes peace on Earth and good will to men, that is willing to live and let live and to do as they would be done by and that loves his neighbor as himself. Self is called a monster, far exceeding the greatest tyrant, although there have been tyrants that have persecuted many thousands of the righteous to death. Olery and <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName> says persecution on the score of conscience has thinned the world of fifty million of human beings. See again <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman's</persName> <title>Caution to the Rich</title>, page 37: now if we single out Domitian, Nero or any other of the persecuting emperors, the man – though terrible in his time – will appear as a tyrant of small consequence compared with this selfish spirit. For though his bounds were large, yet a great part of the world was out of his reach. And though he grievously afflicted the bodies of these innocent people, yet the minds of many were divinely supported in their greatest agonies and, being faithful unto death, were delivered from his tyranny. His reign, though cruel for a time, was soon over, and he, considered in his greatest pomp, appears to have been a slave to selfish spirit. Thus tyranny, as applied to a man, riseth up and soon has an end.
<pb n="002" facs="334403"/>
But if we consider the numerous oppressions of many states and the calamities occasioned by nations contending with nations in various parts and ages of the world and remember that selfishness hath been the original cause of them all; if we consider that those who are unredeemed from this selfish spirit not only afflict others but are afflicted themselves and have no real quietness in this life nor in futurity but, according to the sayings of Christ, have their portion in that painful condition where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched;<note type="editorial">Mark 9:44</note> if we consider the havoc that has been made among mankind, in our age and in ages past, dismal – indeed, monstrous – will that selfish spirit appear to us.</p>
<p>That worthy minister <persName key="w6b38kp0">Thomas Ross</persName> once said it is a great thing to keep self down, and indeed I have thought it was so. For I believe if we could keep self down, we should keep Satan down and that he could have no way to make an inroad upon us. To be clear of self and truly resigned is a great attainment.</p>
<p><l>What cannot resignation do?</l>
<l>It wonders can perform.</l>
<l>That powerful charm, thy will be done,</l>
<l>Can lay the loudest storm.</l><note type="editorial">Edward Young</note></p>

<p><q>Know thyself</q> is enough for man to know. <q>Know thyself</q> was a precept so much noticed amongst the Athenians that it is said that it was wrote in golden letters and set up at the corners of their streets. And I think it is <persName key="w63j7f09">Peter Charron</persName>, in his <title>Book of Wisdom</title>, says that in Spain (where it seems Paul once traveled) this was a proverb amongst them: Preserve me from myself, oh, deliver me from myself. And, indeed, what can be more dreadful than to be left to ourselves, as some formerly were? As it is said, he gave them over to a reprobate mind,<note type="editorial">Romans 1:28</note> and then what dismal fruits and effects followed. Oh, Israel, thy destruction is of thy self.<note type="editorial">Hosea 13:19</note> And indeed, is it not very evident now in our days, the dismal direful effects and fruits of a selfish spirit? Do we not plainly see how people cast off the thing that is good and how the enemy pursues them? And how they pursue lying vanities and forsake their own mercies, so that many live not half their days by cleaving unto wicked ways? See the effects of this selfish spirit.</p>
<p>But let us consider and see the precious fruits and effects of self-denial, of those who have been willing to take up the cross of Christ, who counted nothing too near or dear to part with, although it were as a right hand or a right eye. Throughout all the accounts in Scripture, and in all ages down to these day, we may plainly see the blessed fruits and effects of a righteous life and self-denial and the blessed glorious state and happy attainments. And, on the other hand, we have seen and may clearly see – not only in individuals, but whole nations and societies – what woeful, miserable work a selfish spirit has made amongst mankind, even about religion!
<pb n="003" facs="334404"/>
Hath not this selfish spirit at times made the earth to tremble? The prophet said he saw the tents of Cushan in great affliction and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:7</note> Hath it not been so many a time, and have we not seen it so in our days, when the potsherds of the earth.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 45:9</note> have dashed one against another and made a dismal rattle, when they have grievously tormented and afflicted one another, endeavoring all in the power to destroy and make one another miserable. See here the fruits and effects of this selfish spirit: how different and contrary it is from that spirit which breathes peace on earth and goodwill to men<note type="editorial">Luke 2:14</note></p>
<p>Remember Bonaparte, that great emperor, the great French warrior? They called him an iron-hearted man because of his hard-heartedness and great cruelty in the time of his wars in Germany. See the accounts of the most dismal destruction, desolation, and ruin in the German empire, and we there may see in our days – but a few years ago – the dismal effects and fruits of the selfish spirit, whose power to oppress and distress mankind exceeds for all the power of the greatest tyrants. <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> says when the Lord sent him out into the world to labor in his vineyard and awaken a drowsy world, the world was like a wilderness overgrown with briars and thorns, full of hissing serpents and stinging scorpions, and no right way found out of it. And the people! Many were like lions, bears, wolves, and tigers, ready to destroy him and all the sheep and lambs of Christ. Mark now and consider the fruits and effects of this selfish spirit that has brought the world and the people in it to be worse than the voracious devouring beasts of the wilderness. And we may see how in our days it has degraded many below the beast of the field, for they will only drink till they have enough, but <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> says it is probable that a million of people destroy themselves annually by excessive drinking yearly of strong drink. See here again the direful effects and fruits of that selfish spirit, because they will not deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow Christ.</p>
<p>See here again what this selfish spirit makes of men. See Psalms 140:3: they sharpened their tongues like a serpent. And see Isaiah 14:29: out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice; his fruit shall be as a fiery, flying serpent. See Matthew 3:7: a generation of vipers, <supplied>Matthew</supplied> 12:34, <supplied>Matthew</supplied> 23:33, Luke 3:7, and as Jeremiah 10 chapter says, as a den of dragons.<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 10:22</note> John the Baptist and afterwards our Savior called the Scribes <supplied>Sadducees</supplied> and Pharisees a generation of vipers.<note type="editorial">Matthew 3:7 and 12:34</note> Isaiah 30:6: from whence come the viper and serpent? Again 41:24: your work is worse than of a serpent. And see Isaiah 59:5: they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth; that which is crushed breaks out into viper. So here is the fruits and effects of the selfish spirit, turn saints into sinners, or make saints of sinners as in the case of St. Paul.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> See Hosea 10:1: Israel is an empty vine he bringeth me forth fruit unto himself see not empty in making goodly image is how is it with us.</note>
<pb n="004" facs="334406"/>
<p>See <supplied>James Meikle's</supplied> <title>Solitude Sweetened</title>, page 42, on love in God: the love of God is a fixed and unchangeable love, and the more the soul is in sorrow or distress, the more free and full are the communications of divine love. In the time of need, the world's love will give us the slip. But in the most calamitous circumstance, sacred love performs the part of two loves and sticks closer than a brother. Mortals' loves (alas how many can attest the truth of this) may today appear ardent and steadfast and sincere but tomorrow be entirely cold. Yea, converted into slander, hatred, and revenge. But let all the sons of God know that divine love shall be to them what the holy waters were to the prophet – ever on the increase, till it be an ocean to swim in forever. Against fears on every side this is comfort – that God will rest in his love.</p>
<p>Divine love is also a beneficent love. Jonathan loved David exceedingly, but could not do much for him nor save him from being expelled from his native country. But the love of God is fruitful of every blessing, is the tree that bears all kinds of fruits that nourish the soul and feasts every power. The love of poor men can bring no advantage to the persons loved. But when God sets his love upon a sinner, all at once he who had nothing of late has all things: life, liberty, friends riches, glory, a kingdom, sufficiency here and all sufficiency hereafter – in a word, all that can be named, sought after, wished for, or thought upon. Then, ye sons of earth, hug yourselves in the embrace of wealth and bless your own condition, but presume not that you are the favorites of Heaven because his common providence pours upon you. As for me, may I be the object of his love and, in spite of poverty, I am rich; in spite of sin, I am secure and walk on triumphantly to the better country. O, how very different is this love here treated as from that selfish spirit just before treated on. How precious the fruits and effects, how far transcending all earthly treasures or glory.</p>
<p>A certain writer says a selfish spirit is the worst companion. It has led very many into a most sorrowful, dismal state and condition, as it did the young man that would feign have filled his belly with the husks the swine had left.<note type="editorial">Luke 15:16</note> They that cast of the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue them<note type="editorial">Hosea 8:3</note>; and they that pursue lying vanities forsake their own mercies. So it is many live not half their days by cleaving unto wicked ways.</p>
<p>Seneca says: oh, ye miserable mortals, how many afflictions you do endure, which might be easily prevented. So indeed it is. What miserable vagabonds there are, poor wretched, degraded, creatures – all for want of taking up the cross to their own wills. Oh Israel, thy destruction is of thyself, but thy help is in me.<note type="editorial">Hosea 13:9</note> A man's worst enemies are those of his own house,<note type="editorial">William Blake</note> and he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy. See Acts 14:16: who in time past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.</p>
<lg><quote type="poem"><l>He is more than a prince that rules himself,</l>
<l>Than he who nations keep in awe:</l>

I believe it ended to general satisfaction. If our hearts condemn us not, then have confidence towards God, said the apostle.<note type="editorial">1 John 3:21</note> But, O, alas, what room and need there is of improvement!</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-08-04"><head><supplied>August 1820</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1820-08-04">4 was Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> Instead of going to our meeting, I felt most easy to go to the burial of a little girl, about 10 years old, at Joseph Cole's. A family brought up and professing the Church of England, a poor orphan child. I expected there would be but very few there, it being a very busy season. They buried her in the churchyard. There was but a small company, but behaved very orderly and well; and I had an open satisfactory time with them, and there was something sweet, owning, kind, and inviting at parting at the grave. Who can estimate or calculate, set a price on peace and tranquility of mind? It is to be feared very few consider the worth of it. Thy loving kindness is better than life, David said.<note type="editorial">Psalm 63:3</note></p></div>

I have long wanted to go to see them, he being lately disowned at Haddonfield on account of a contentious lawsuit between him and his first cousin, S. Thorn, about a very little gore of land for which R. Burroughs offered to settle the matter with them for 10 dollars. But no, he said he would not buy that which was his own and so to law they went and spent 200 dollars at court and lawyers on each side and not ended yet. Verily, said Paul, there is a fault among you brother goes to law with brother.<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 6:7</note> I had some relief and satisfaction, but no prospect of doing much, if any, good. There seemed to be no room for anything but what concerns earthly affairs. Perhaps that which is better – too little sought for by any of us or desired.<note type="editorial">At Haddonfield Monthly Meeting, 12th Month 1819, a <q>testimony of disunion</q> was presented for Reuben Burrough who <q>so far departed from the good order of the Society as to act improperly in the conduct and in conversation relating to a disputed case, for which breach of order he has been deal with but not manifesting a suitable disposition of mind to make an acknowledgment the meeting came to a conclusion to disown him.</q></note></p>
<p>We now hear that the fever is broke out again in town in divers places, and it is said there has been a most dreadful hail storm down about Malakee <supplied>Mullica</supplied> Hill. And Woodstown, it is said the hail stones was as big as an egg that it destroyed fields of Indian corn and killed some calves. But it reached but a little ways, a mile or two.</p></div>

Few ages have more needed such a public testimony to the value of time, and perhaps none had a more conspicuous example of the perfection to which the improvement of it may be carried.</p>
<p>At our meeting. To me a mortifying time because <supplied>there was</supplied> not that clothing ability, evident ownings of truth, and sweetness and savor of life as at some other times.

<div type="entry" n="1820-08-11"><dateline><date when="1820-08-11">11.</date></dateline><p> Having some business that way, I was at Evesham Monthly Meeting, and a more open, owning time I hardly ever had there, strengthening.

<div type="entry" n="1820-08-13"><dateline><date when="1820-08-13">13.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I am so poorly this morning I concluded I could not go to meeting. But feeling a little better after breakfast, <rs key="w68x44wf">my</rs> <rs key="w6136j8n">daughters</rs> and I went to Cropwell, where I have been talking of going weeks past. <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName> we found there. The waters to me seemed very low, but <persName key="w6md9qck">H.H.</persName> took up almost the whole time of the meeting, and I had some little relief and satisfaction at last and hope it ended pretty well. This afternoon, having the approbation of our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern, which ended to my sweet satisfaction. There was some most miserable, old, distressed drunkards there who showed loving and respectfull to me, although I had dealt very plain and close with them on that great and crying sin of drunkenness. It was satisfactory to look over the day.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-08-17"><dateline><date when="1820-08-17">17.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting. I thought rather smaller than common, yet there was something very lively stirring amongst us. <persName key="w6mt4j9v">Joseph Cowperthwaite</persName>, who has appeared in meeting several years at times and has lain ill last winter in a deep consumption, is got out again and looks like one arose from the dead or brink of the grave. Had very considerable to say, and divers others. I believe it ended to general satisfaction. I suppose there were some strangers from Philadelphia. They say there is now a very serious alarm on account of the prevalence of the fever. 4, it is said, died lately out of one house. One Ingle, a young man, it is said catched the disorder (a fat man) and died suddenly up Ancocas. And our neighbor Joseph Cole (where I was at the burial a few days ago of a girl) yesterday buried one of his boys with a strange disorder, which the doctor tells them is as catching as the measles, on which account they buried him without making a little, if any, invitation to his burial. The disorder, they say, has gone through the family, except the old folks. Several of their daughters have been very ill. I think they call it the Scarlet Fever, attended with sore throat. Oh, how many serious calls to a devout and holy life, after divers ways and divers manners, attended with too little effect.</p></div>

Matlack his wife and daughter paid us a visit and tells us that there two barns burnt with lightning lately in Pennsylvania – one very large, at a great tavern, and eight horses burnt in it: And I was told a few days ago there was fifty sheep killed with the thunder under a tree.

<div type="entry" n="1820-08-20 1"><dateline><date when="1820-08-20">20.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I picked up a bit of an old newspaper dated April 15, 1818 (called <title>Village Record</title>): thus it appears that in the city and liberties of Philadelphia only, within the last 4 years 1420 persons have fallen a sacrifice by the ravages of this disorder of mankind (the consumption of the lungs) as certified by the Board of Health and signed John Allison, clerk for the years 1814, 1815, and 1816, and for the year 1817 signed Joseph Prior. From the 1st of January 1814 to the last of January 1815, 274 persons have died of the consumption of the lungs. From the first of January 1816 to the first of January 1817 to December 1817, 362 died with the consumption. It is there said it appear by the bills of mortality that more people die of consumptions and disorders in the breast and lungs than any other disorder.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-08-20 2"><dateline><date when="1820-08-20">20.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting waters very low. Many very dull and drowsy. Amos Hilburn of Byberry was there, but it seemed as if he could or did not rise to say anything. I had a few sentences at last to good satisfaction. With leave from our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at our schoolhouse at 4th hour. A number of very raw young people who seemed to choose to stand about the door rather than come in, but we did get them in. Forepart was a very poor, stripping, trying time to me, but through mercy it growed better. Some young ministers – <persName key="w6mt4j9v">Joseph Cowperthwaite</persName>, <persName key="w66v1c5g">Ebenezer Roberts</persName>, and Hannah Warrington – were highly favored, and I was helped beyond expectation, and a lively time it was at last, I believe to general satisfaction. There were divers there very seldom get to meeting of any sort. One of these said it was the most satisfactory meeting they was ever at in their lives.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-08-27"><dateline><date when="1820-08-27">27.</date></dateline><p> Eighth Month. First Day. I have weeks past been looking towards Haddonfield, and now, with <persName key="w6mt4j9v">Joseph Cowperthwaite</persName> to Haddonfield. The meeting was very large, and to me the most open, evidently owing time I ever seen there. We put up and dined at a tavern, Thomas Porter's, an old acquaintance and native of our neighborhood who kindly entertained us gratis. We had a sitting with him and wife and their ancient mother, and was at their afternoon meeting, which was very small. But we were favored to come off with good satisfaction and returned with sweet peace, although religion there is very low, trampled underfoot, kicked out of doors by very many.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1820-09-05"><dateline><date when="1820-09-05">5.</date></dateline><p> We hear of the great distress at Philadelphia. The fever, they say, rages in an alarming manner and is very mortal. They bury them, ‘tis said, in the night, and carriages going all hours of the night.

But as we read in Job, where shall wisdom be found, and where is the place of understanding? The depths saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not in me. No mention shall be made of coral or of pearl, the Topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall gold or silver be weighed for the price thereof for the price of wisdom is far above rubies.<note type="editorial">Job 28:12-18</note> And then see the conclusion: the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is good understanding.<note type="editorial">Job 28:28</note></p>
<p>But alas, how is the fear of the Lord banished in our days. The cause of truth and true religion treated as a very trifling thing, even as a fable not worth much noticing, trampled under foot and kicked out of doors with very many. Christ is said to be the wisdom of God and the power of God.<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 1:24</note> Solomon says, see Proverbs 16 and 16 verse: how much better it is to get wisdom than gold. A house full of gold would do nothing for a dying man, but the favor of wisdom, Christ, would do all he could wish for. 19 and 8: he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul, say<supplied>s</supplied> Solomon.

1820. See Ecclesiastes 8 and 1st verse: a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine. And indeed I have often thought the folly of the poor drunkard hath made their faces to look very dismal, and many others who have given way to gross wickedness; their faces are marked with a dismal appearance. But on all the vessels of the Lord's house is this inscription: Holiness to the Lord <note type="editorial">Exodus 39:30</note>.

<div type="entry" n="1820-09-07"><dateline><date when="1820-09-07">Ninth Month, 7.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting we had a shower of strangers from Byberry, Pennsylvania. Sweet, worthy, amiable, able ministers: our cousin <persName key="w6g77m31">Hannah Yarnal</persName>; Amos Hilburn; Mary Walkton, a maiden; Warder Cresson a youth about 22, and they all had lively, pertinent, sweet, acceptable service. A lively, highly favored time it was, I believe.</p></div>

The above named strangers were there, and cousin Hannah was raised in great eminence in the exercise of her gift, and Mary Walkton and Warder Cresson, and an open, solemn, favored time it was. I did think something of an heavenly nature did attend throughout. But oh, how are very many set down at ease and settled on their lease<note type="editorial">lees?</note>, although we daily hear of the language of mortality waxing louder and louder, both to the city and country. The pestilential fever prevailing in an awful manner; several lately dying raving, distracted. It is said one so much so as to bite his pillow, and another took or 4 men to keep him on his bed, here in our neighborhood.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-09-10"><dateline><date when="1820-09-10">10.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting. I went as a blank, destitute of any prospect or desire of being heard – but quite the contrary. We sat so long in silence that several left the meeting, but at last life did seem to rise into dominion, and I believe it ended very savory and reputably. There were several from Pennsylvania: <persName key="w6md9qk8">James Simson</persName>, son of <persName key="w68m543d">John Simpson</persName>, who appeared lively in the ministry. I spent several hours with him and wife at <persName key="w6mt4j9v">Joseph Cowperthwaite's</persName>, and then at 4 hour went to the burial of Sarah, the wife of Samuel Matlack, who has lain some weeks or days past very ill with the gravel. Left a large family of children, mostly grown up. I had a few sentences at the grave to some satisfaction.</p>
<p>We have had a long spell of very dry weather; no rain this many weeks. People could not go on with sowing their rye – but now came a very soaking rain.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-09-13"><dateline><date when="1820-09-13">13.</date></dateline><p> At select meeting at Haddonfield. <persName key="w65d92g1">William Foster</persName> from England was there, and <persName key="w6mw2sk8">Stephen Grellet</persName>, the Frenchman of New York, very lately returned from a vast extensive visit to the European nations, and divers others strangers.

<div type="entry" n="1820-09-14"><dateline><date when="1820-09-14">14th of the Ninth Month, 1820.</date></dateline><p> Was our quarterly meeting at Haddonfield. It was very large, and to me very poor and dry and dull. But as Barclay compares the wording of the spirit to throwing a little water in a pump and working it brings up the rest, so it seemed to be. For <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> rose up with life and power and it brought a change of feeling, and then <persName key="w65d92g1">William Foster</persName>, lately from England, was large in testimony. And <persName key="w6mw2sk8">Stephen Grellet</persName> of New York, and very lately returned the second time from a very extensive visit to the European nations, had extensive weighty service. So it seemed to grow better and better till <supplied>at</supplied> last it was a lively, searching time, as it were, with lighted candles. Especially on the subject of putting the discipline in practice I had great relief, having been burdened and been hammering and stammering at it many years past, on account of the fullness of our answers respecting putting the discipline in practice.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-09-17"><dateline><date when="1820-09-17">17.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. At our meeting. Sort of middling, not so savory as some.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-09-21"><dateline><date when="1820-09-21">21.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day meeting morning. I am thinking of the query we have concerning becoming or unbecoming behavior at meetings, and what sort of behavior is becoming the solemnity of the occasion, and what sort of men and women ought we to be, and in what manner we should attend our religious meetings. Certainly it should be in the most humble, reverent, dependant state, as our ancestors did present their bodies, a living sacrifice, in the most reverent, humble, dependant state, even to contrition, trembling, and tears (whereby they got the name of Tremblers or Quakers) – a state very different from a trifling easy, lukewarm, indifferent state overwhelmed with drowsiness.</p></div>

See <title>Journal of <persName key="w6n87x9b">Job Scott</persName></title>, the ups and the downs he had to experience, sometimes so cast down as ready to question all he had ever experienced of heavenly goodness. <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> and many others also.</p></div>

There was excellent outward order, but oh the need of being like minded with David, who prayed that a right spirit might be renewed within him.<note type="editorial">Psalm 51:10</note> Oh, the need I thought there was of more tender hearts whereon some impressions might be made,
<pb n="011" facs="334415"/>
For indeed neither mercies nor judgments seem not to have the desired effect in bring about the desired reformation. I could see but little or no signs of the inwarded life, the hidden life, the life that's hid with Christ in God, the life of God in the soul of Man. I fear the people have lost sight of it and see nothing of the necessity of it and are set down quite easy with a mere moral righteousness, although the language of mortality and waxed louder and louder in both cities and parts of the country. I am told that a malignant fever is very mortal at the town of Savannah, and that it a very sickly time in Salem County, especially at Manington etc. This was a very stormy day. A very great rain after several weeks of very pinching, dry weather and a complaint of wells getting dry.</p>
<p>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness.<note type="editorial">Matthew 5:6</note> But we seem to be set down, quite contented with a moral righteousness, although we see we stand in need of something more when calamity overtakes us. See Acts 17:27: That they should seek the Lord if haply they might feel after him and find him, though he be not far from everyone of us. What a strange thing it would be nowadays to recommend this to the people at burials. Oh, how foreign from their thoughts or desires, although our first friends say it was their concern when they met together to feel the Lord amongst them, and oh how he did at times manifest himself among them to the opening their hearts and contriting their spirits, even to tears, so that at times there was scarcely a dry eye amongst them – although silent and not a word spoken in their gatherings. Alas, where are we, or what is the chaff to the wheat,<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 23:28</note> the shell to the kernel? An exact decent outward form to the substance of true vital religion.</p>
<p>We sat in an old room with the corpse, just newly vamped up in the new mode. Very nice. I could but think of the corpse as it lay before us, and the new finished room, and how humble and contented the old people had lived in it, to my knowledge. How pride and superfluity looks when put together at these awful seasons.</p>
<lg>
<l>Be not proud by any means;</l>
<l>Build not your house too high,</l>
<l>But always have before your eyes</l>
<l>That you were born to die.</l>
</lg>
<p>Said the martyr: people may try the many ways, but they will never find a better than that the Scriptures point out, which is straight and narrow, low and humble. Oh, what wisdom there appears in it at the solemn, awful close.</p></div>

In the course of the meeting I had at several times some remarks or sentences to drop, which, on considering of on my bed, I could not wish to recall – but yet so it was at last.

<p>This afternoon I mended two pumps: one for Joseph Rogers and one for his son. Got a fall from the top of the pump and I think had like to have broke my arm, so I am now very lame in my left arm.</p>
<p>I picked up a little choice book, the life of Jane Pearson, see page 61, and mine eyes saw with unspeakable astonishment that we fret for things unworthy the notice of a redeemed mind, and that if I or my Friends with whom I sat were but called upon to take their leave of everything below the sun, all these perplexing anxieties would vanish like an atom in the whirlwind and be of no weight at all. We should then only lament that we had not looked above these momentary afflictions and fixed our confidence on the invisible arm and invincible power of omnipotence. But oh! how is the natural part attracted by visible objects, while that which is born from above suffers through our not adhering to the invisible.</p>
<p>See again Jane Pearson's journal, page 72: In danger of being like Gideon, who after his great achievement made an Ephod and, idolizing it, the same became a snare to him. Sixth Month 30th 1802. – I was at our weekday meeting and was favored with a solemn silence, resembling that in Heaven, where angels and archangels adore in profound silence. I saw into the joys thereof; a place where sorrow cannot come: none of the inhabitants have any affliction and favored with Heavenly bread.</p></div>

Again, see Jane Pearson's Life, page 84: I seemed not dandled on the knee – I will bear it. For oh!

<div type="entry" n="1820-11-05"><dateline><date when="1820-11-05">5 of the Eleventh Month 1820 was First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Not much satisfaction… search for the cause. I dread being at ease in Zion, say Jane Pearson. Well would it be if it was the case with all, but how natural it is, when we live in fullness, to sit down at ease and scuttle on our leas. Like the man we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully and he concluded he had goods laid up in store for many years and said to his soul, eat, drink. and take thy rest, etc. But see what a dangerous state it was, and how unwise. For it was said unto him: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided? And so shall it be with all those who say up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God.<note type="editorial">Luke 12:19-21</note></p>
<p>Then is it not a dangerous time? For although I have seen eighty years, I think I never seen a more plentiful season for rye, wheat, Indian corn, oats, buckwheat, potatoes, and apple in abundance, and the finest, largest, and fairest I ever seen, so that there is scarcely room to contain them or casks to hold the cider. But oh, how are these precious blessing<supplied>s</supplied> turned into a destructive, poisonous spirit, a destructive man bane blast nation stuff, as a poor drunk and called it. And how little regard is paid to that dreadful war pronounced by the prophet: to them that fuel the battle to their neighbor, the cup of the Lord's right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spring shall be upon thy glory.<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 2:16</note></p>
<p>If people were too openly declare they did not believe the Scriptures it would be no matter of wonder, they do as they do. But to profess to believe in the Scriptures and do as they do, what can be more diametrically opposite? What sort of a people were they whose root, the Prophet said, should be as rottenness and their blossom flee away as dust? And as Jane Pearson says, when they are called upon to bid adieu to their earthly idols then their fascinating schemes flee away as atoms in the whirlwind and leave them empty.</p></div>

<p>We hear of a very remarkable accident or hand of providence. Mahlon Bud of Mount Holly one night was at a tavern with considerable company drinking. Stepped out to go to the necessary, which stood on the edge of the creek. He found some in the little house and went, it is said, and leaned beside the fence, which gave way and he fell into the creek and was drowned immediately. They soon missed him out of their company, searched for and found him. It is said he left one dead drunk on the floor. He bore the character of a hard drinker and great libertine.

His testimony was much against formality, profession without possession, power and like. <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName> also had something pertinent and savory. At last something opened to me on this wise: we have read and heard much said of the fame of religion – the Christian religion, and what great things it has done for people in days of old – and we have seen even down to these days what great things religion has done for the faithful and obedient. But what hath it done for us, and what is the state of religion in our days? We have had line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little – yea, more here a great deal and there a great deal – and what hath it done for us? We are told that where much is given, much will be required. And what was to be the doom of that servant that knew his matters will and did it not? We have been an highly favored people, favored with the upper and the nether springs,<note type="editorial">Judges 1:15</note> favored with the dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth (few if any more so).<note type="editorial">Genesis 27:28</note> May not the language be applied to us: Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thee as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing.<note type="editorial">Luke 13:34</note> Why then are we not gathered, and how shall we escape if we neglect to avail ourselves of such offers of love? And will the whole world be price enough to ransom us or countervail our loss? The meeting broke up whilst I was in fear of hurting what had been said.

Samuel Church went with me and he expressed great satisfaction with our visit. Then we went to see Benjamin Hopewell, in his 73rd year. He served his apprenticeship with my father. He has been greatly afflicted with a disease in his feet and ankles; had in early life given way to intemperance but is reformed from it. Then we went to see Samuel Sharp in his 91st year; he expressed gladness with our visit. Then we went to see Sibbila Duril and Rubin Haines, who have lost their reason and are 2 of the most sorrowful objects that I know of. Here away there were several others I wanted to see, but time did not admit of it. I have some months past thought of Solomon's words: it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of mirth.<note type="editorial">Ecclesiastes 7:2</note> I thought I would try it and it is not unpleasant to look back and think how I spent the day.</p></div>

E.R. and J.J. had a great deal to say, with which I find all were not altogether satisfied. It is a comfort that I was preserved from doing any harm.

Both of us in our 81st year, nearly of an age. In his youthful days he took great liberty and was very wild in his career. He got on board a man of war and was taken to England and got reduced to great poverty, yet was favored to find friends so that he got home and applied himself to industry. Married my old master's daughter, Mary Matlack, raised up a family of children, accumulated wealth, and sustained the character of a temperate, frugal, quiet, peaceable, honest, insensitive, innocent man. There were a large concourse of people at parting at the grave. I had a few sentences to impart to the people, to peace and satisfaction of my own mind.

I went begging for preservation and resignation, and was favored to come off without condemnation, with good satisfaction in some communications to the people at the house.</p>
<p>This afternoon I went to see my old schoolmate Thomas Hooton, who is very poorly in his 87th year. He and his children expressed satisfaction with our visit and I had no cause to repent it.</p></div>

<p>Last First Day Joseph Gill's wife was buried. A young woman, left several children. He was at market the Fourth Day before she was buried. <supplied>She</supplied> got a cold and typhus fever, followed a lad, one [indecipherable], to be buried today 29 at Evesham, where it is said the scarlet fever prevails. It is a wonder such sudden deaths does not raise a concern amongst us to be prepared to leave this world. Seneca says: Oh, ye miserable mortals! The frailties of your nature are little thought of and when it is, it is in such a way it is to little purpose. I suppose to think of it to purpose we must be like minded with the prophet David when he petitioned the Lord to teach him to know his end and the number of his days, that he might know how frail he was. And again he says: Teach me so to number my days that I may apply my heart to wisdom.<note type="editorial">Psalm 90:12</note> This would indeed be to purpose and not otherwise.</p>
<p><persName key="w65q5g7f">Samuel Fothergill</persName> speaks of a way of living to the best and wisest and happiest of purpose, without which he says people had better never have lived. And those who do live to the best of purposes obtain the hope of the righteous. As the Scripture says, the righteous hath hope in his death<note type="editorial">Proverbs 14:32</note> and he says without this blessed hope we are of all living creatures and of all the animal creation the most miserable. For whilst man in this imperfect state of being is confined, How many pains invade his outward frame, how many sorrows vex his mind!</p>
<p>Seneca further says: Oh, ye miserable mortals, how many sorrows and afflictions do you endure which might be easily avoided by daily attending to that preserving Christian principle without which we are like sheep on the mountains in the wilderness with out a shepherd,<note type="editorial">Mark 6:34</note> amongst briers and thorns and voracious devouring beasts, the spirits of people like wolves, bears, lions, and tigers, etc., etc. As <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> says, when the Lord first sent him forth to labor in his vineyard to awaken a drowsy world it was like to a wilderness, and no right way found out of it. And the spirits of many were like wolves, bears, lions, and tigers, ready to destroy him and all the lambs and sheep of Christ. And will not like causes produce like effects? Are we coming up out of the wilderness, like the true church formerly and like our worthy progenitors, or are we going back into the wilderness, trampling on the testimony they so deeply suffered for?</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1820-12-27"><dateline><date when="1820-12-27">27 of the Twelfth Month.</date></dateline><p> I received a letter from my son <persName key="w6vz1749">Joseph</persName> giving an account of a gentleman from Baltimore came with his overseer to take one of his slaves about ten miles from his house at night. The slave shot his master dead and beat the overseer so that he died in a few days, for which he is now in heavy chains in Winchester [West Chester]  gaol. What dismal work amongst men, which true religion, if rightly adhered to, would easily prevent, as Seneca says.</p></div>

Many pertinent remarks were made tending to stir up to faithfulness. But alas what room and need there is of improvement in weightiness and solidity and wisdom.</p>
<p>A few days ago, an Indian near Haddonfield agreed with a black man to let him make baskets in his house. After some time, one evening, got some rum or whiskey and drinked too much. And as he slept by the fire they were very much afraid to leave him alone, but did put up the fire and went to bed. And in the night they heard him hallow and ran to him, and his clothes was all on fire. They tore them off, but he was badly burnt, but yet went again after more rum because the man had emptied his jug. The weather being very cold and he, exposing himself, got cold and died presently.

Many kind friends came to see me and tried to comfort and encourage me, but I was afraid my spiritual state was not so good as they seemed to think it was. For one said he had not the least doubt but all would be well if I went now, another said – to encourage me when at the worst – if thee goes now the will leave a good savor; thee has done a great deal of good in the world.

<p>But all this will not do at such a time as this. At last as M. Haines said nothing but the Lord, nothing but [indecipherable] the Lord will do.

See page 223: <quote>Instead of being present at my devotions where I stand or kneel, I am carried to various places, just as my roving thoughts have led me. Where my thoughts are, there I properly am; and my thoughts are chiefly with that which I most love. (Those objects too soon recur which corrupt nature or sinful habit have made delightfull.) Upon this ground it is that thou hast declared expressly that where the treasure is, there will the heart be also.<note type="editorial">Matthew 6:21</note> And accordingly, I find in the various resolutions of my changeable heart that when I love heaven, I take pleasure in meditating on Heavenly enjoyments. When I love the world, I think on its advantages with delight and with sorrow on its troubles. When I love the flesh, my imagination wanders through its various pleasures. When I love the spirit, my faculties are with Holy joy devoted to spiritual exercises. Whatever I chiefly love, of that I delight chiefly to hear and speak and I carry home with me the diversified images it, even to my most secret retirement.</quote></p>
<p>It is said the Waldenses used to say that whatever people loved best, that was their god, that they delight to think and meditate upon. When I have sat in our meetings and seen signs, tokens, and indications of a wandering mind, I have often thought of a piece of an old Scotch song I have heard – <quote>My heart is in Highlands, my heart is not here; my heart is in the Highlands a-chasing of the deer; chasing of the buck and hunting of the doe.</quote> My heart is in the Highlands whilst the body is at meeting.

    <p>I have lately had put into my hands a book giving an account of the sect called the Shaking Quakers, and it is vastly different from the account of our first Friends coming forth. Be ye not deceived was the caution formerly. It is greatly to be feared that many, very many, are greatly deceived; they think they have attained to the greatest state of Christian perfection of any people ever have done, although they [indecipherable]. They sometimes dance naked, men and women together, and sometimes are constrained, they say, to bark like a dog and make a noise like a cat. Miracles, they say, are not ceased among them, but many great miracles are done among them. Many strange imaginations they take it to be greatly feared for revelations. Some we read of who boasted they were the children of Abraham, but were told they were of their father the Devil. So we may see how possible it is for people to be greatly deceived in their spiritual or religious state, although exceedingly] confident that they are right. They forbid marriage amongst them, or men and women lying or sleeping together, or even touching one another, and find Scripture for all this grievous sorrowful work. In many instances where families have been broken up by men or women joining their society and parting when they have had families of young children – sorrowful to relate.</p></div>

What an awful, humbling lesson to the greatest and best of men – how unable, when they are right and highly favored of the Lord, to keep so. See how quickly and grievously David fell after being so highly favored of the Lord. And hath not this been the case with very many, since, as Isidore used to say, he that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory give him a greater overthrow than his former vices.

God must be all, in all, in us here or we cannot be his hereafter. Time works only for eternity, and poverty eternal must as certainly follow him who dies only fully stuffed with human learning as he who dies only full of worldly riches. The folly of thinking to have any divine learning but that which the Holy Ghost teaches, or to make ourselves rich towards God by heaps of commonplace learning crowded into our minds, will leave us as dreadfully cheated as that rich builder of barns in the gospel, to whom it was said: thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall all these things be which thou hast provided.<note type="editorial">Luke 12:19-21</note> So is every man that treasures up religious learning that comes not wholly from the spirit of God.</p></div>

The winter was very hard, the spring very cold and backward. Many was very late sowing in the fall, and the winter grain looked very poor in the spring. But there came a showery wet time, and it got up beyond all expectation and there appeared a fine prospect of a good harvest, but they say it is very light grained. There has been a kind of rust blast or mildew in some places, so that some fields where there was plenty of straw they say it is so blasted that it will hardly pay for reaping. And in some places, they say a kind of a little insect eats of the roots of young Indian corn, and has quite spoiled it in some places. How many ways there are for the fruits of the field and the labors of the husband man to be laid waste! As we read, it is said in Scripture: ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and the seed of an omer shall yield but an ephah.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 5:10</note> Or, he can open the windows and heaven and pour down blessings until there is hardly room to contain them.<note type="editorial">Malachi 3:10</note></p>
<p>See <title>Christian Magazine</title>, page 454: surely if there be any thing that dignifies the man, it is the homage he pays to God. And if there be anything that debases us, it is the total want of a taste for spiritual and holy things. This is evidently demonstrated in the example of many being raised from a very low estate to sit among the heads of the tribes and princes of the people. And, on the other hand, how many have fallen into a poor, low, degraded state who once lived in a very reputable way?

If nothing sets a person so much out of the Devil's reach as humility, then is there any thing that sets a person in Devil's reach and power as pride does? Humility goes before honor, but pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 16:18</note> This has been often verified – not only in many individuals, but whole nations. Again, page 470: shall the angels of God witness that we prefer the empty toys to the pearl of infinite, inestimable, unchangeable volume? Empty toys indeed to the riches and earthly treasure appear to be hardly a name little enough to call them by at last when they must be parted with.

As one says, I have now lost what words cannot compensate: My God has withdrawn from me. His presence, oh no more.</p>
    <p>Let me review and examine the direful cause of this. Wither, O my beloved, art thou gone? It needs no diligent search to find out the cause of thine absence. Well do I remember – ah awful season, <supplied>I</supplied> grew lukewarm and careless! I slighted the mercies of God and trifled with my privileges. Well, he is gone. Unhappy soul, whither shall I fly? Shall I ascend up into Heaven? He is there in his glory. Shall descend in Hell? He is there in his terrors. Shall I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the earth? There also his hand would find me. Whither then shall I go? From his presence I cannot fly. Poor man has no hiding place but in the munition of rocks. Arise, o God, for my help, nor suffer me never to rest contented without thy presence, in which David says is fullness of joy and his kindness better than life,<note type="editorial">Psalm 63:3</note> the loss of which the whole world cannot compensate. As <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, thy life is upon it, thy soul is at stake.

I both feel and see what an excellent thing it would be to live without a will of our own, but alas, how unable we are of ourselves when we are right to keep so. Although David could say the spirit of the Lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue,<note type="editorial">2 Samuel 23:2</note> yet the very next chapter he charges himself with great folly and wickedness, which brought great destruction on them – seventy thousand died in 3 days of the pestilence, upwards of 23 thousand died in a day with the pestilence.<note type="editorial">2 Samuel 24:15</note>

<p>Would not true humility have prevented this destruction if, like Mordecai after he had be in clothed with the king's apparel and sat upon the king's horse, he returned humbly and sat at the king's gate?<note type="editorial">Esther 6:11-12</note> And do we not read so of Daniel, after he had been distinguished by favored of the Lord, <supplied>he</supplied> went and sat at the king's gate.<note type="editorial">Daniel 2:49</note> What instructing lessons to keep humble after times of favor!</p>
<p>But my weakness has been such that I have been hard beset to keep from being proud after times of favor – elevated, tickled, pleased – which has brought sufferings on me many times, and made me visit to be trusted with much. For the times of favor have been the very cause of the fall of such weaklings as Isidore. Used to say he that grown better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory give him a greater overthrow than his former vices. For pride is apt to grow up on our virtues as upon our vices.</p>
<p>See <title>Christian Magazine</title>, page 239: he loves Christ not at all that loves him not above all. If religion be worth anything, it is worth everything. How many thousand of the martyrs and primitive Christians and our first Friends have chosen rather to suffer, to die the most cruel deaths – burned at the stake, hanged on the gallows, starved in dungeons and prisons, and banishment – rather than part with their religion. Whilst unknown numbers in prosperity are preferring the transitory treasures of this world and, like Esau, selling their birthright for a mess of pottage<note type="editorial">Genesis 25:30-33</note> and then too late sought it with tears, but found it not.</p>

<p>See <title>Christian Magazine</title>, page 325: Christ is not prized at all unless he is prized above all. If we wish to grow in grace, it must be by the sincere milk of the word. Those who bring nothing but expect all things are the most welcome to come to Christ. The greatest and hardest work of a Christian is least in sight, which is the well doing of his heart. I never knew an eminent saint but he had either singular afflictions or singular corruptions to wrestle with. If I win Christ, I am rich towards God; if I am found in Christ, I am safe; if I know him, I am wise to salvation. Let the bitterness of sin make grace sweet and the sweetness of grace make sin bitter.</p>
<p>Seven arguments for contentment: (1) we have more than we deserve (2) we have more that we ever well improved (3) we have more than many of God's dear children (4) we have more of this world than the Lord Jesus Christ had (5) we have more than we brought into the world and more than we can carry out (6) we have as much as infinite wisdom thinks best for us (7) if we have Christ and grace, we have what is better than all the world.</p>
<p>It is better to beg one's bread with Lazarus on earth than to beg one's water with divers in hell. Paul counted all but dross and dung that he might win Christ. <note type="editorial">Philippians 3:8</note> If we win Christ, we have all we need. If we loose Christ, we lose all. If the Lord gives himself, can they be poor – though stript of all, as Job was – who obtain his favor? But are they not poor creatures, although they may have goods laid up in store for many years? Without his favor, we are poor creatures; with it, we are rich. <supplied>He</supplied> takes what he will away.</p></div>

<p>See <title>Christian Magazine</title>, page 239: He loves Christ not at all who loves him not above all. They are justly punished that abuse lawful things, but they are most justly punished that use unlawful things. Thus Lucifer fell from Heaven, thus Adam lost his paradise. The life of man is the middle between angels and beasts. If man takes pleasure in carnal things, he is compared to beasts; but if he delight in spiritual things, he is suited with angels. How are some ever brothers of one family raised up and some degraded and cast down below the beasts, wallowing in their pollutions and drunkenness. Many shorten their days. What was that which Moses told the Children of Israel was not a vain thing: it is your life and by it ye shall prolong your days. If religion is worth any thing, it is worth all things. If it can bring us any goodness, it can bring all goodness we stand in need of, so is the one thing needful. But see Romans 1st and 31: without understanding covenant breakers, without natural affections, implacable and unmerciful.

And what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?<note type="editorial">Mark 8:36</note> If nature is indulged, grace, as to sense of it, takes its flight. Is not nature greatly indulged in these days? How gloomy the prospects.</p></div>
