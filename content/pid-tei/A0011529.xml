                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

Reaping – had eleven hands, and with very hard scrabbling they cut it all down about fourteen acres and on the whole very good.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-07-19"><dateline><date when="1817-07-19">19.</date></dateline><p> We got about two-thirds of it in. A smart shower catched some.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-07-20"><dateline><date when="1817-07-20">20. First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. A very poor, low shut up time. Almost completely overwhelmed with ease, dullness, and indifferency. Hardly deserved the name of a meeting. I pitied the sincere seekers. Getting in our harvest and hay. Weather showery, but we scrabbled and got along very well. Our barn never better filled with grain and choice, good hay.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-07-24"><dateline><date when="1817-07-24">24. Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Very small, people very busy getting in grain and hay. Weather rainy, but yet I believe harvest is generally got in. Our meeting, though low and poor, I thought not destitute of some savor of life and ownings of truth. Came off without condemnation. I have read an account that the persecutors of our first Friends said of them that they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground, but they lived and attended their meetings so as to make it answer a good purpose. They pleased the Lord and obtained his favor, and that was enough and far transcended all this world could afford. But they did not tend their meetings in a poor, dry, formal way, nor were they overwhelmed with a spirit of ease and dullness.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-07-28"><dateline><date when="1817-07-28">28. First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. I thought it a very poor, low time, but I don't know, for I was so unwell I could hardly sit meeting. William Ashby of Philadelphia came to see me Seventh Day night and will at meeting and had acceptable service and <persName key="w66v1c5g">Ebenezer Roberts</persName>, also <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and children, and William Ashby went to a meeting at four at the schoolhouse near the Green Tree Tavern and they say they had a very open, good meeting. <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Hain</persName> appointed it and was very large among a people who seldom tend any sort of meeting. I have been twelve months trying to open a door amongst them, and now I hope it will be occupied. This is the 2nd meeting with them. Very busy getting hay and favored to get along, though it goes very hard with me.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> I so poorly I could not go with them.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-07-31"><dateline><date when="1817-07-31">Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting I thought to me more lively, open and satisfactory than common. By thee, said David, have I run through a troop and leaped over a wall.<note type="editorial">Psalm 18:29</note> We have many troops to encounter and walls of opposition.</p></div>

First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> of Newtown, Pennsylvania, was there (the meeting large) and Edward had very great deal to say. Stood, I reckon, more than an hour. A great and powerful preacher, but, oh, the dullness of many hearers! Not as it was at the preaching of Peter, where several thousands were converted at one time and as it was in the days of <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName>, when great numbers were convinced at one meeting and when tenderness and brokenness of heart prevailed so that the tears often trickled down their cheeks and sometime, it is said, the floor was sprinkled with tears like to a sprinkling of rain. However, I thought I seen a tear, which is a great rarity now a days – under the greatest and most powerful preachers we have many frequently sit nodding.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-04"><dateline><date when="1817-08-04">4.</date></dateline><p> On Second Day <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> had a meeting at Lower Evesham and had a great deal to say. Stood, I suppose, more than a hour.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-05"><dateline><date when="1817-08-05">5. Third Day.</date></dateline><p> I went to see an old man and his wife several miles beyond Upper Evesham, found her in a very afflicted condition with the rheumatism. Then down to Upper Evesham meeting. <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> had a great deal to say, and I thought it ended sweet and savory. Then I went to see Job Chambers, who a few days ago had a loaded wagon with hay run over him – and his life has been much despaired of – but is getting better and to see Susannah Balinger, in a very languishing condition and very low and poor. Then called to see William Glover, afflicted greatly with a rheumatic complaint, a young man with a family.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-06"><dateline><date when="1817-08-06">6.</date></dateline><p> Fourth Day I was at Cropwell with <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName>. He generally stands more than an hour and is very searching. This afternoon at 4th hour we had a meeting at a schoolhouse near the green tree tavern. Edward was very large there also. Then he and his companion Steven Comfort came home with me to lodge.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-07"><dateline><date when="1817-08-07">7.</date></dateline><p> On Fifth Day we were at our Monthly Meeting and I think it was a favored, good meeting and ended savory and well. <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> and a great deal to say and very searching and pertinent.

<p>About a horse at I. C. Lent. We had a sweet time in the company of our friends <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> and Steven Comfort. I was ready to call him sterling, staunch, steady, standard Steven Comfort. After our Monthly Meeting they went home. A very great rain after some weeks dry weather.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-10"><dateline><date when="1817-08-10">10 was First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. <persName key="w6xt6kpr">Ann Edwards</persName> got home after six weeks, perhaps, out in Pennsylvania. She said a little, and at last the weight fell on me, and I don't know whether I ever stood up in a meeting in more diffidence and fear of myself but through mercy come off with satisfaction.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-11"><dateline><date when="1817-08-11">11th. Second Day.</date></dateline><p> Very rainy and a very watery aspect at present.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-12"><dateline><date when="1817-08-12">12.</date></dateline><p> Rained all day and all night. A great storm.</p>
<p><persName key="w63g5dz0">John Parrish</persName>, my dear old intimate friend, said he sometimes had thoughts in the night which he thought was too good to be lost and used to rise up and get his pocket book and pencil and write in the dark so that he might not forget the subject. How precious are thy thoughts unto me, oh God, and how great are the sum of them. If I should count them, they are more than the sands of the sea. When I awake I am still with thee, said the prophet David.<note type="editorial">Psalms 139: 118-119</note> Thoughts: third Day morning very rainy. We read of the good remembrancer that was promised should come and would bring all things needful into remembrance. And he said, my sheep hear my voice and follow me.<note type="editorial">John 10:26-7</note> and the voice of a stranger they will not follow. And again we read in the Old Testament: they shall know how to refuse the evil and choose the good<note type="editorial">Isaiah 7:16</note> There is a spirit in man and it is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth them an understanding.<note type="editorial">Job 32:8</note> Said Elihu, is not this the great thing in religion - to learn, to understand, and distinguish between the voice of the stranger and true teacher and to know how to refuse the evil and choose the good? It seems as if people in common believe these things. See <persName key="w6kf2phb">Thomas Chalkley's</persName> account: an old woman found him crying and asked what was the matter. He said he did not know without it was because he was a naughty boy. She said, it's the devil tells you so, for you are the best boy in all our street.</p></div>
<pb n="004" facs="335078"/>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-12"><dateline><date when="1817-08-12">12.</date></dateline><p> Eighth Month, 1817. Third day morning very rainy. William Shewen?<note type="editorial"><title>Counsel to the Christian Traveler</title></note> says vain thoughts are great troublers of the world and the language of the prophet Jeremiah was: wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts [be] lodged within thee<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 14:4</note> Only observe how that when any alarming calamity approaches, how vain thoughts are turned out and willingness wrought in them to make room for their betters. In the time of the plague in London, it is said, the people were all in tears, and I heard <persName key="w6p953wx">N.S.</persName> say when the yellow fever raged in Philadelphia that they might stop and talk with a neighbor in the streets at that time and frequently see the tears run down their cheeks. There, says he, was silent worship. So we read the law of the Lord is sure, enlightening the eyes, the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul and making wise the simple.<note type="editorial">Psalm 19:7</note> Although people are generally so taken up with the crowding cares and [encumbering concerns of this world, very many find no time to consider of nor care nor to prepare for the world to come. Only see how it is, how all worldly concerns sink into an equal nothingness – hardly a name little enough to call them by! Then, as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, the cry is a world of gold and of pearl for a little more time when as they had given up all their precious time for a little of this transitory world. Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of spirit,<note type="editorial">Ecclesiastes 1:2</note> Solomon.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-14"><dateline><date when="1817-08-14">14.</date></dateline><p> My daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> and I went to Woodbury Quarterly Meeting with our neighbor, Samuel Church, and Abigail Matlack. It was a very large meeting and divers worthy, able ministers – <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName>, <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName>, Simon Gilum, <persName key="w6gq882n">R. J.</persName>, and E. Hicks – were much shut up, and the labor in the ministry seemed to fall on some of rather smaller gifts – on Simon Gilum, myself and some others. I thought there was something of a solemn, quieting, heavenly nature and it ended savory and well and that thought for business was an open, good time.</p></div>
<pb n="005" facs="335079"/>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-15"><dateline><date when="1817-08-15">15.</date></dateline><p> Were at Youth's meeting at the Woodbury. Service in the ministry fell to the lot of Simon Gilum and myself and some others. <persName key="w68w3qrz">Edward Hicks</persName> did appear in supplication, and I believe it ended well and to general satisfaction. We dined at John Tathame, Jr., where there was a house full, some aged, middle aged, and youth. My mind was arrested with some thoughts which seemed to me was not altogether for myself. I mentioned it to Simon Gilum, and we had sitting with them and a lively, owning time I believe it was. We lodged at <persName key="w6b38ksb">James Cooper's</persName> where was a house pretty well filled with Friends, but none appeared concerned to bring back the King. Does not the King of Kings stand still knocking at the door of our hearts? Oh, how seldom we do as well as we might do! I thought the minds of the people wanted to be raised from lower sublunary enjoyments to something more divine and sublime. I thought the ancient language was applicable to us, viz.: lift up your heads, ye doors, and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting gates, and the king of glory shall come in. Who is his King of glory? The Lord of Host, he is King of glory,<note type="editorial">Psalm 24:7-9</note> and as Azariah testified to the people of Judah and Benjamin and told them the Lord would be with them whilst they were with him and if they sought him he would be found of them, etc..<note type="editorial">2 Chronicles 15:2</note> Oh, to think of the great offers held out to our acceptance! How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation?</p>
<p>At this meeting I seen many of my old acquaintances of Salem and between here and there who expressed great gladness and love and respect for me. I thought I never seen the like before; it was affecting almost to tears, the feeling nearness and uniting regard, the expressions of kindness and inviting language, I having been weakly and sickly and confined at home very much for seven years past.</p>
<p>Whilst I was at Woodbury I heard of several remarkable, sorrowful scenes. A few days ago a woman was so frightened with the thunder she went into convulsion fits and died in a very short time and left young children near Woodbury. And in the time of these late great rains and high winds that at Baltimore the floods of water swept off some horses with the families in them and that the arches of the bridge became choked up with rubbish that the flood raised so high as to come up to the second floor of some houses, and some lives were lost. And at Little York the like dreadful accounts and some say fifty drowned and found in Delaware since the storm.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1817-08-17"><dateline><date when="1817-08-17">17 of the Eighth Month, 1817, was First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Very poor and low forepart, and no wonder! A state of ease and indolence seems to have gained the ascendancy over very many. I thought it would overwhelm all, but at last I ventured and was helped beyond expectation and came off without condemnation, although the waters were very low. The scarcity of bread is for want of labor and the scarcity of water for want of digging. <persName key="w6xt6kpr">Ann Edwards</persName> appeared in prayer, and I thought the meeting ended savory and well at last.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-21"><dateline><date when="1817-08-21">21. Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. The words of the prophet sweetly accompanied my mind; see Psalms 87 and 3rd: glorious things are spoken of thee, oh City of God, and of the apostles. Expressions of the fruit and effects of true religion and the blessed and great attainment of that church and people to whom he wrote his epistle. He tells them they had come to the new and heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the saints' solemnity, to the church of the firstborn whose names were written in Heaven.<note type="editorial">Hebrews 12:22-23</note> And are we endured with rational understandings, capacitates, gifts, and talents capable, if rightly improved, to attain to the like blessed experience in some good degree. And how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation, etc., etc.?<note type="editorial">Hebrews 2:3</note> The meeting was very small, and in answering the queries there was so much dryness and formality, so much of the creaturely man's part, I had hardly patience enough to bear it, and I fear scraped rather harder than some could well bear. But on the whole, feel pretty well satisfied.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-22"><dateline><date when="1817-08-22">22.</date></dateline><p> This morning I picked up a piece of newspaper dated 15 of August, 1817, <title>Relf's Philadelphia Gazette</title>, giving accounts of the dreadful distress and destruction of the great floods and inundations of waters occasioned by the late great rains at Washington City, August 13, and at Baltimore and places adjacent - of the destruction of their mills of all sorts and manufactories of all sorts and at Little York. At some places the flood swept away many houses of diver sorts and people in them were crying for help as they floated down the stream on the tops of the houses, and none could help them, but some were taken into boats out of the windows. The damage in mills and manufacture, dams, bridges, etc., can hardly be recovered or estimated.
<pb n="007" facs="335081"/>
An account of a dreadful storm in New England and eastward we had a few years ago wherein many lives were lost as at this, and as great destruction in mills and stores. As at this time they say the streets near the scene of this dreadful misfortune are covered with ruins and that this was a terrible visitation of providence and will be too many unfortunate people irretrievable in its consequences. This flood is said to have risen from four to six feet higher than the memorable flood of ‘86. This imperfect sketch is – rely on it – is by no means exaggerated but in truth comes short of a full picture of the distress. So we read, fear ye him who can terribly shake the Earth<note type="editorial">Isaiah 2:19</note> and whom the clouds, winds, [and] waves of the sea obey. But, alas, what little lasting impression they make and how soon forgotten. Even the destruction of the world by Noah's flood and the destruction of Sodom and the great and mighty acts of the Lord by sword, pestilence, famine, etc., etc., etc., and earthquakes! What vast countries and cities and multitudes of people; many thousand sunk into ruin in a few minutes!</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> An account also eastward of dreadful destruction by floods of rain. One man, it is said, lost  acres of famous wheat.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-24"><dateline><date when="1817-08-24">24. First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting, pretty large. John Hallock of Egg Harbor (a native of New York government married a poor girl, Lydia, brought up with us) he had very acceptable service and <persName key="w6xt6kpr">Ann Edwards</persName> also, and it was a satisfactory, open time to me. I thought an unusual quiet, stillness, and solemnity attended the meeting.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-08-28"><dateline><date when="1817-08-28">28. Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. I had a choice to be silent but was not and have no cause to repent it.

It is said she had joined the Roman Catholics in Philadelphia; however, there were a number of women, perhaps a dozen or fifteen, who, when the coffin was let down into the grave, all fell to saying something I could not understand but in a very serious, solemn manner and continued their ceremony near fifteen minutes. There was, I thought, something very serious, savory, solemn, and weighty in it, affecting and trusting. They tell me they were French Negroes of the Roman Catholic religion.

<p>Had an appointed meeting there which was to me a time hard getting along, a sort of mortifying labor, as <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> expresses it. But several sweet little ministers helped out and it ended pretty well, I believe. This afternoon, Thomas Davis, Sarah Scull and Rebeck Hubbs (my cousin) went with us to visit the county poorhouse, where was a number of most distressed, miserable objects. Some lost their reason and were chained, and some lost their limbs, and some silly, not common sense, and some lost their reason by fits. We had a meeting with them. T.D., S.S., and R.H. had pertinent matter for the poor distressed creatures, and tenderness even to tears appeared in some that were blind, and I hope it was for the better. I forgot in its place we had with some young people at David Davis' at parting, a very sweet, tendering time. We left them pretty plentifully bathed in tears. Elizabeth Lippincott, a very hopefully young minister, and Sarah Scull and Rebeckah Hubbs had very sweet service. From the poorhouse we went home with Joseph Bassit, who had come up to Woodstown on purpose to take us to his house to lodge, where were very kindly received.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-10-05"><dateline><date when="1817-10-05">5th was First Day.</date></dateline><p> We went to Salem meeting, a very large house and well filled, where I had an open, owning time for more than an hour, like a full flowing tide.

Then called to see a widow and her daughter Phebe Miller, an old acquaintance, a native of our parts. There we had a very satisfactory time at parting, the widow being very weakly and not able to get out to meeting. Then we went to Jame Den's (to lodge at Alloways Creek), whose wife is a sweet minister and an old acquaintance. We were at their meeting, an appointed one, which my companions think was a very good meeting, but I thought it not so open as some others were.</p></div>

    <p>Next day, were at an appointed meeting, there where I was much disappointed. Having been there some years ago and found things so very poor and low, I went there with reluctance. But my mind was now replenished with a hope and some apprehensions of a revival of life, that I had and open, owning, satisfactory time to general satisfaction, I believe. At parting at Asa Kerby's we had a very tendering time with a young woman. Several women friends about Piles Grove and Salem told me the tendering impression they had received when they were children in opportunities or sittings in their fathers' houses 30 or more years ago, when I used to attend Salem Quarterly Meeting, and the words that I had expressed had made lasting impression on their minds. And now several of them become grandmothers and useful members of society and one of them a minister in good esteem. But in some families where our lots were cast, there seemed to be no room for any such thing as a religious opportunity. But I observed that if the discourse turned on worldly affairs – fatting of cattle, telling how many bushels of wheat they had raised on an acre, and other grain, and how many hundred pounds of flax they had on an acre – then I found they were in their element, very wise and knowing about worldly business. And the world had opened her mouth and swallowed them up like the briars and thorns choked the good seed<note type="editorial">Matthew 13:22</note> and as to religion they were become as dwarfs, mopes, and cripples besotted. We came from Asa Hirbey's up to Woodbury, lodged at Samuel Micles.</p>

<p>Fifth day, 9th of the Tenth Month. We were at Woodbury Monthly Meeting, at which, through mercy, I was helped and strengthened beyond expectation, having been so unwell I could eat neither breakfast nor dinner. So we got through fully according to prospect and I believe parted with our friends with an evidence of the ownings of truth and feeling nearness and uniting regard, and got well home to my house after meeting and found all well, all of which mercies call for humble gratitude and dedication of heart. At Penn's Neck and Piles Grove there is a dreadful alarm with mad dogs, which have bit many creatures and some people.</p></div>

This day we heard of three burials: Deborah Stuart of Haddonfield, a worthy, sweet minister of an unblemished character about seventy; and Esther Venable of Moorestown, a widow upwards of eighty; and William Rowlands of Vincentown, a most miserable drunkard [who] left a wife and family of children. And a young man came up from Philadelphia to Moorestown, went with others in a party of pleasuring, got to diverting themselves with a large swing in the time of meeting when that worthy able minister Joseph Hoag from New England was at Moorestown. The young man got a fall and, it is said, cracked his skull so that he lay some days speechless and his life yet despaired of. And at or near the same time a man and woman was drowned at Philadelphia and several more narrowly escaped drowning through some mismanagement getting on the steamboat.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-10-16"><dateline><date when="1817-10-16">16. Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. I went with a hope and willingness to have a silent meeting. There were divers strangers, young doctors. I felt an exercise and knew not for who it was. One of these young doctors, a comely young man, had give way to excess in drink, and – as I was told after – somewhat alarmed with the sudden death of the youth killed with the swing, who we now hear is dead. I had something for them, but not (as I thought) with that strength and ability as I have been favored with latterly. However, not much cause of complaint. The young doctors, though several quite strangers, got round me and seemed very respectful. I am told that they think Deborah Stuart's death was occasioned by a fall in the street near her own door. She fell with her breast on the root of a tree and hurt her very much. One would think her situation as much out of danger as any, but strange to think how accidents happen which no care or precaution of ours can prevent, and the many ways that bring people to their end.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1817-10-23"><dateline><date when="1817-10-23">23. Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Though small, was a lively, strengthening one to me, tending to unite to the wise in heart. Although in general, as far as I can hear, it is and has been a very healthy season, yet we almost daily hear the language of mortality sounded in our ears. We now hear of the very sudden death of James Wood, middle-aged, a wealthy man near Haddonfield. It is thought he died with an apoplectic fit. And of the death of Samuel Key, near Haddonfield, a very hard drinker in the midst of his days – left a widow and children. And at the same time of the death of a black young woman at Moorestown. Thus the ancient decree, almost as old as the creation – dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return<note type="editorial">Genesis 3:19</note> – we see an almost daily fulfilling. And to take a view of the bulk of mankind as a family at large, it is said that many are dropping into eternity every minute. And as Daniel Stanton said on hearing of the death of a friend, our time is a coming. And <persName key="w6b38kp0">Thomas Ross</persName> once said, when he heard of the death of Mordecai Yarnall, a worthy minister, well, says he, repeating it over and over, Mordecai is gone; by and by we shall be gone.

The people conducted very orderly, and it was cordial and comfortable to see so much of a Christian like spirit in attending him in his illness and at the burial. But yet it seemed to me it was too much in the spirit of Martha of old, to whom Christ said, Martha, Martha thou art careful about many things; one thing is needful.<note type="editorial">Luke 10:41-2</note>]  . And the mind not enough turned towards the better part which Mary had choice, of which should never be taken from her that so we might know more of the evidence and ownings of truth and the savor of life and the great Master's presence amongst us at these solemn seasons. In thy presence, said David, is fullness of joy, etc.<note type="editorial">Psalm 16:11</note> I came off middling well, well satisfied.</p></div>

<p>Fourth Day. 19. Amos Peasley of New England (who was with us some month ago) appointed a meeting at Moorestown which was pretty large, and I thought he did famously and worthily. A large door of utterance, but I thought a door of entrance was much wanting. Powerful preachers and dull hearers, not like it was when three thousand was converted at the preaching of Peter and when hundreds were convinced at one meeting in the days of <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> and <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> when there was often much tenderness and contrition, but now more frequently dullness and drowsiness and sleeping instead of weeping under the most powerful ministers. A great rarity to see a tear or tokens of tenderness.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> But they seem to think nothing of going any further.</note>
<pb n="016" facs="335090"/>
<p>Plenty makes dainty and the full stomach loathes the honeycomb.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 27:7</note> As Daniel Stanton said when he was told how the people at Moorestown was pleased with his preaching and wished he lived there to be there every First Day – how glad they should be to go to hear him - ah, said he, I reckoned it would soon be like an old song. And as <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> said when the people of New England was so taken with his preaching they began to consult together to hire him to stay with them to preach to them, he said it was time for him to be gone. But when he seen people at their meetings settled down in solemn silence with their minds turned towards the Lord, then he said they were finally settled in the truth.</p>
<p>This morning we heard of a dismal accident or scene of sorrow. A lad about 18 years of age lived with our neighbor Joseph Hugg, got up about 2 o'clock at night to help his master get ready to go to market. His master got up about fifteen minutes after him and found him on the fire, burnt to death. He carried him to the pump to put out the fire on his clothes but could perceive little or no signs of life. He was subject to fits and had fell in the fire once before, but they pulled him out so that he received no hurt, only singed his hair.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1817-11-20"><dateline><date when="1817-11-20">20.</date></dateline><p> I went to the burial of this young man that was burnt to death. The family in which he lived were not members of our society nor the people gathered, but they conducted soberly, orderly, and well, and I had an open time with them with which one of the near relations of the deceased expressed satisfaction. At the grave I had a few sentences to good satisfaction. We heard of two burials this day at Moorestown, a man and a young woman. Although it is counted a very healthy season in general, both in city and country, yet we hear of deaths almost daily or very frequently.</p></div>

Mary Lukins was my companion when I visited the families of their meeting. They went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting.</p>

Betsey Purington of New England, Samuel Rhodes of Darby, Simon Gillum and divers others of Pennsylvania and Philadelphia. The largest meeting ever seen there, perhaps, and as solemn and orderly as I ever seen there.</p>
<p>There was a solemnity, savor, and sweetness in the silent part that strengthened a hope that we were advancing towards that state which is better and beyond words, which is the end of all good words or gospel ministry: the superior excellency of the Christian religion, which is a communion with Christ.</p></div>

Nathan Yarnal of Philadelphia – a well approved young minister, I hear – they talk of taking him to the asylum newly erected for such who lose their reason, and James Frinch's wife also quite crazy.

<div type="entry" n="1818-02-08"><dateline><date when="1818-02-08">8 was First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. It was a mortifying time to me, and perhaps good and needful for me.

<p>Sixth Day our select meeting. Our daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> went with me for the first time. Some thought it a favored, lively time to select meeting. Not fully so to me; rough work not the pleasantest, but sometimes necessary. We hear that an ancient woman went to warm her cape and it catched fire and set her clothes on fire and burnt so that she soon died (Sarah King's mother at Slabtown, 4 miles above [Mount] Holley).</p>

This afternoon we went to the burial of our neighbor, Benjamin Williamson's wife (died sudden with a stroke of palsy). They had their Baptist minister there and high doings preaching, and singing of psalms, prayers, etc. Some thought there was some salt, savor, and life, but if it was so, it was all hid from me. Yet I thought it was an instructing time to me, under a feeling sense of the difference between ability which truth gives and the want of it. Our meeting last First Day did not leave a comfortless, mortifying remembrance, but quite otherwise. A very great storm of rain and at last considerable snow and cold weather. Very changeable from warm to cold.</p>
<p>Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting and I think I [have] seldom, if ever, seen a more lively, evidently owning a time. From first to last answering queries there was great openness for labor, and very many very pertinent remarks were made and savor and life attended. Is it not a wonder, every thing considered, that we should be thus followed and favored in the first part? I had an evident, owning, favored time. Oh, how it calls for humility!</p>
<p>Fourth Day last, that violent stormy day, Solomon Sanders near Cropwell was buried. [He was] in the midst of his days [and] left a family, wife and children. Few, if any, have exceeded him in the improvements of worldly affairs.

<p><persName key="w6cv5qpd">William Law</persName> says conscience is God's (vice-regent for judge). When we do right and do well, we find acceptance and justification. Our conscience justifies us when we do well; when we do not do well, it condemns.

<l>They that live with her at strife,</l>
<l>Parts with their better friend for life.</l></p>

They owned me, and I believe there was something of an evidence of the ownings of truth, and I came off with right good satisfaction. At Cole's Church, as it is called.</p></div>

Came off pretty well satisfied, but great room and need for improvement. I have my trials, the wormwood and the gall to partake of. No longer watch, no longer safe, nor then neither; except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain.<note type="editorial">Psalm 127:1</note> We now hear of latter time a great many instances of people breaking or falling greatly in debt, bankruptcies of one breaking in debt and breaking and plunging others and their families in difficulty and poverty and divers who made a very great show. Diverse who were thought and thought themselves prospered of a great deal of worldly wealth, riches, and earthly treasure and who had pursued earthly treasure in a very large, extensive manner. Yet things have turned out so that divers of these will not have enough to pay their debts. Some forced to go to gaol who had made a very great show in the circle of very high life. And we hear very straight and clear of divers murders committed about Allentown; a black man stabbed a white man with his knife so that he died quickly and a malicious black boy for revenge throwed a white child into a well. What a sink of depravity is this world without religion, without attention to that preserving, right-ordering, regulating principle placed in every heart.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1818-04-05"><dateline><date when="1818-04-05">5 was First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. I went with almost a determined conclusion to have a silent meeting but yet very desirous to do right, for I know nothing else will do. But so it was I put off out of season and if right seasons are mixed right services are lost. So it seemed as if did not get through with my lesson. After meeting I found some from a great distance and I believe stood in need of what was given to me. Yet I had satisfaction as far as I went. A burial was spoke of which seemed hurt the meeting – it being, as I thought, spoke of too early – or I believe I should have tried to have go through. I had concluded to go this day to Ancocas meeting, but, it being so very stormy, I gave out going.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1818-04-06"><dateline><date when="1818-04-06">6th of the Fourth Month, 1818.</date></dateline><p> Went to the burial of Mary Gibbs, an old acquaintance from our youth, the daughter of Robert Finch, a minister in good esteem. She [was] near my age. The company [was] not very large but very still and quiet; the practice of talking at burials as formerly is nearly dropt and done with, but yet great need of a more lively inward traveled. [There was a] want of life and savor. I had but hardish work getting along, though came off middling at the grave. I felt nothing to say till the very last, [when] a few sentences sprung up and it did right well and afforded satisfaction. The people seemed pleased, sweet and pleasant, very kind and inviting. I could but notice that one poor old drunkard (and even then a little fuddled) should have such a sense and feeling when and where there was a little life and ownings of truth stirring, for he followed me and was very pressing and inviting me to come and see him. And also one other neighbor was very pressing and inviting.</p></div>

My cousin Benne Warrington took me over to Ancocas meeting and through unmerited mercy it was the most open, evidently owning time I ever had there, for near about one hour and a half. Never did there appear more sweetness, feeling nearness, and uniting, inviting kindness. But we came directly home.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Joseph Bispham's store was broke open and robbed of 150 dollars. The thief is now detected by his leaving a gimlet where he broke open the window, which some could say (by a knot in the handle) they had seen a carpenter use. Which, when he was taxed with the crime, he could not deny. A smart young man of a reputable family eastward. I have often sympathized and felt for the youth in their temptation.</p>
<p>This day heard of the death of William Wilkins. He died sudden with the gravel this day three weeks ago. He was well several years younger than me. His first wife, Sarah, [was] a worthy minister, but he married lately and not reputably. See the dangers.

Last Seventh day night I had a remarkable dream at cousin Henry Warrington's. I thought I was in a room with a number of people and that there was an unusual solemnity, and I thought my voice was lifted up beyond what I ever experienced, seemingly beyond its natural power. But the consoling, comfortable feeling that attended it was far the most remarkable, for it seemed to do me good to the heart and made me think of <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty's</persName> words in his diary: soliloquy a song in the night. In the morning I went to Ancocas meeting, where was something a little or a good deal like it. But, oh, how hard it is to keep right when we are so! For so we read the heavens are not clean in his sight.<note type="editorial">Job 15:15</note> and he chargeth his angels with folly<note type="editorial">Job 4:18</note></p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1818-04-16"><dateline><date when="1818-04-16">16 was Fifth Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting. Exceedingly attacked with a spirit of ease, indolence, and lukewarmness, which seemed to me almost ready to overwhelm and swallow up all. Yet several had something today and in that complaining way. <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs>e thinks I did very well, but I thought it a very poor time (but I was unwell; was not fit to be out).</p></div>

We attended the several sittings of this yearly meeting, except I missed one. It concluded Sixth Day about noon. Some sittings were very trying and rather afflicting, but some were very solemn, favored, instructing seasons where my lot was cast. We had at divers times sweet, uniting, satisfactory opportunities in families. The love and near unity many of my old friends and acquaintances expressed of seeing me once more was beyond what I can readily describe, and was very humbling and very tendering and affecting. Very many were like mirrors or looking glass to me. Some were so weak as to express great gladness in hearing a few sentences, which I thought they had better be very sparing of however. It is a great mercy to be so far preserved and kept from sinking.</p></div>

But I could see but little animation. I believe the people take too much opium, anodyne, sleepy drops. Powerful preachers and dull hearers; it is like a pleasant song now, as we read it was in the days of the Prophet.<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 33:32</note></p></div>

I went and we went to see Samuel Laning and wife, [an] old acquaintance, quite blind [for] many years. Then I went to see the sick man in deep consumption and came off with pretty good satisfaction, although at some places it seem hard work to come at anything savory or lively. This day's work wearied down.</p></div>

The people chiefly such who never make no pretenses to any religion. I expected the strangers home with me, but they stole them from me till next morning they came and <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> and I went with them to Haddonfield meeting.

<p>Although the fatigue was almost more than I was able to bear, so that at the meeting the forepart the infirmities of old age and the very great want of a more living concern, I felt as if I must pass the meeting in silence. Yet through mercy was helped and strengthened with an evidence of the ownings of truth. At last, however, they were very open, kind, and inviting, especially a great man, a magistrate, a man of a good disposition and natural abilities. I called to see <persName key="w6jj4bpx">Jacob Hollinshed</persName> – aged about 84, a very constant attender of our meetings till a few months past to satisfaction. Got well home, well satisfied, although I did not seem to get quite clear of Mount Holly meeting, which I have been thinking of some weeks. Their language was over and over, one after another, come and see us again come and see us again, etc.</p>
<p>A few sentiments of <persName key="w6086z81">Benjamin Lay</persName>: Money the love of money – the destruction of nations – the foundation of evil. Again he admires Numa Pamplilias [Pompilius] when he refused the Kingdom. Oh, wise Numa, famous virtue! Again he admires the wisdom of Lucurgus in preventing foreign wares and merchandise. He says, I admire the wisdom of that man. Again he notes William Edmondson's words: Mammon – cursed love of Mammon. Mammon surfeits and corrupts the mind and darkens the understanding. Oh, the blessed doctrine and practice of the first Christians, which kept out luxury, pride, and cursed covetousness. Again, the joy at selfish spirit is Satan's spirit. Again, a few things serve a right mind; find the world's glory hath destroyed many.</p></div>

At our Monthly Meeting William Williams from Indiana western territory and was large in testimony. [He is] a work man that need not be ashamed, yet some speak lightly of such as he.

<div type="entry" n="1818-05-08"><dateline><date when="1818-05-08">8th.</date></dateline><p> I went to see a poor sick woman who seemed much in the innocency to satisfaction, then went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. William Williams was there but silent and left the meeting, he being taken very sick. I left him at Isaac Haines's; they got the doctor to him. I came off without condemnation, although rough work. Weakness prevails there.

We have had a very severe, cold winter and but little snow, so that the winter grain is very much killed on heavy land. Many field[s] look as if they would not produce the seed again; many say they never seen the like. How many ways are the fruits of the field destroyed! And a very cold backward spring, but very few warm days, which makes it seem more admirable that there was on the 6 of the Fifth Month, 1818, a very heavy thunder shower here with us and in other places. It is said the thunder and lightning was most tremendous towards or at Lancaster and in order parts of Pennsylvania. I am told several barns were burnt with the lightning and some creature[s] (horses, etc.) were burnt in them, and others very narrowly escaped being burnt. Oh, to think of the many solemn calls and warnings after divers ways and divers manners. But oh, how blind, how deaf and stupid we! We don't consider and we will not see!</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1818-05-10"><dateline><date when="1818-05-10">10th of the Fifth Month. First Day.</date></dateline><p> At our meeting, and a precious, open, owning time. Some besides myself thought it was scarcely if ever seen the like there. William Ashby of Philadelphia told me he thought I had gotten a new lease, etc., etc. But, oh, the different sentiments concerning ministry! However it need not trouble us, if we can but have [the] peace that fortifies and crowns all.</p>
<p>William Ashby went with me to see D. Stokes's widow of large family of children and we had an open, owning time then, so he thought it a favored day, well spent.</p></div>
