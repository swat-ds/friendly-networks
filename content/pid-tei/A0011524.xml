                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

They are in such vast plenty in our Jersey land and a very good harvest for rye and wheat and the greatest prospect of a vast great crop of Indian corn and buckwheat that ever was known yet I am told by eye witnesses that a little below Salem they have had a pinching time of drought so that a few weeks ago they could rub the corn leaves to snuff,  and  a Friend who lately traveled through New England Isaac C. Jones told me a great drought prevailed through that part of the country eastward especially in province of Maine so called. The drought is mentioned in the newspapers very piercing indeed in the time of this dry weather the fire broke out the wind being very high and raged to a great degree spread over and consumed a great part of the country burnt up and destroyed, many settlements so that many great farmers who had lived in affluence and plenty were now by that means reduced to poverty and want being burnt out of house and home.</p>
<p>See William Edmundson's <title>Journal </title>an account of a time of great scarcity which was soon succeeded [by] a time of great plenty which was made known to him and he had to prophecy foretell and forewarn the people and told the people the Lord would lash them with his judgment and dung [?] the ground with the carcasses of men which shortly after soon came to pass,  and many died for want of bread and tuffs of rank green grass were seen on the common where carcasses of people had dunged the ground and s<damage><gap/></damage> his prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
