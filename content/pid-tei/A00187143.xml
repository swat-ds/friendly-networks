            <p>
            It has been much on my mind to write to thee for some time past, partly as an acknowledgment for thy several acceptable communications to me, and mainly for the love and regard my spirit feels towards thee, having been refreshed in thy company and at thy house both spiritually and temporally. I have been much instructed and entertained (as well as my family and some of our particular friends) with thy long letters, and should be glad they might be continued as thou feels the current flow. My engagements have been various since my wife and I were at thy house, but not much from home. Had an appointed meeting near this place (Montgomery Square), where Friends of our meeting formerly held meetings on First Day afternoons in the summertime. It was on first day afternoon the meeting was appointed. I was glad to hear the remarks of a very noted man (one Wager) on the occasion. He attended, and observed that religion only softened the morals of people, that the laws of the land might be fully and rigorously put in execution and the people all the while grow worse until they become savage. He said he therefore thought much of these meetings and could gladly encourage them, believing that the people of the neighborhood had need of improvement (which indeed was true enough). He and his wife wished me to continue meetings on first day afternoons, but I was glad to feel released from an exercise that had long attended my mind. If I had time enough I might fill my sheet full, tho' nothing but love to communicate in particular. We are all in good health, which is a favor, as it is sickly in the neighborhood. I received thy message of love by Salatheel Cleaver when he was lately over at Moorestown.

                It is a day in which there is much religious speculation afloat and uncertain and changeable doctrines in the busy bustling world, which makes it necessary for Friends to keep to their plain way of living and their plain way of preaching, that they may not be misunderstood in neither life or conversation. I have latterly been much instructed in reading the works of Isaac Pennington, find them richly stored with most excellent matter. I believe if Friends would read them with unbiased minds they need not be uninformed, and if they would try the spirits whether they be of God, they need not be deceived with false doctrine. I should be glad to fill my sheet this time but time forbids. Please tell thy son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John</persName> I received his kind letter and intend answer it soon and complying with his request as far as practicable.
