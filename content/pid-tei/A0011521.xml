                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

Then we visited S. Longstaff, a young woman who had made request. Then we visited Phebe Burr confined with the consumption. And I think it was a day of favor in a good degree especially the last night.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-06"><dateline><date when="1788-03-06">6.</date></dateline><p> We visited our school and came off well though close plain dealing was necessary.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Darling said at parting he could not express the consolation he had in our company and was tender even to tears.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-07"><dateline><date when="1788-03-07">7.</date></dateline><p> Was our Monthly Meeting. I met the committee on Negro cases. There appeared encouragement to labor with some not professing with us and Friends seemed under the concern and care of divers matter. Monthly Meeting came on and on the whole it was I thought a favored time. There appeared strength to go through the business in the authority of truth to good satisfaction.<note type="editorial">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1788: <q>Our Friend John Hunt laid before this meeting an engagement that had for some time attended his Mind, and of late had revised with increasing weight, to have a Meeting with the inhabitants at and near Longscoming, requesting our sympathy and concurrence therein, which was obtained; and he left at liberty to proceed therein as way may open, and <persName key="w6jb6xn6">Joshua Lippincott</persName>, <persName key="w6165774">John Collins</persName>, and <persName key="w6wt9jhx">Enoch Evans</persName> appointed to accompany him therein and report to this meeting when performed</q> and Negro Meeting appointed.</note></p>

<div type="entry" n="1788-03-09"><dateline><date when="1788-03-09">9.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. At our meeting, a full crowded meeting. One of our doctors came in with his hat in his hand and the magistrate with him and divers others seldom seen there, the Lord was pleased to favor us with victory over a light speculative state and a good solid meeting it was this afternoon we stopped at the house. The burial of Ephraim Stiles his wife who died very suddenly. Has some satisfaction came off middling well. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1788-03-11"><dateline><date when="1788-03-11">11.</date></dateline><p> Was our meeting. <persName key="w60h49r3">William Roberts</persName> and E.

<div type="entry" n="1788-03-12"><dateline><date when="1788-03-12">12.</date></dateline><p> About some plows.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-13"><dateline><date when="1788-03-13">13.</date></dateline><p> D<supplied>itt</supplied>o. Afternoon I went to see John Hollinshead involved in great trouble thought to be in danger of losing his reason.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-14"><dateline><date when="1788-03-14">14.</date></dateline><p> I went after a load of rails.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1788-03-16"><dateline><date when="1788-03-16">16.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I went to Evesham meeting. The forepart was hard but after a hard tugging time it ended to my satisfaction so that it was no hardship to travel on foot.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-17"><dateline><date when="1788-03-17">17.</date></dateline><p> About home at plows.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-18"><dateline><date when="1788-03-18">18.</date></dateline><p> Went to our meeting. Had a sad time. Something the matter with me or some of my Friends. I could not get along. A sickening time.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-19"><dateline><date when="1788-03-19">19.</date></dateline><p> At work at home.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-20"><dateline><date when="1788-03-20">20.</date></dateline><p> Was our select meeting at Haddonfield. A poor low time as I thought.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-21"><dateline><date when="1788-03-21">21.</date></dateline><p> Was Quarterly Meeting. We had a great deal of preaching but I thought it but a poor time. I proceeded towards Philadelphia with <persName key="w63s1j4g">Solomon Gaskill</persName>, <persName key="w6nk4g54">Thomas Scattergood</persName>, <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> and divers others. <persName key="w6nk4g54">Thomas Scattergood</persName>, William R. and I stopped to see John Burroughs who has lately has his leg cut off and is very low, hardly like to recover. I thought we had a favored time with him and he expressed satisfaction with the visit.
<pb n="003" facs="334754"/>
We went to <persName key="w66f6jrx">Joseph Kaighn's</persName> to lodge. Had a sitting with his brother's family in the evening and another in the morning with his to some advantage I hope.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-22"><dateline><date when="1788-03-22">22 of the Third Month, 1788.</date></dateline><p> Was select meeting at town which was solid and thought by the elders committee to be well conducted. I went this afternoon with <persName key="w6jb6xn6">Joshua Lippincott</persName>, <persName key="w6165774">John Collins</persName>, and <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> to see Leah Middleton, business which concerned our Monthly Meeting a close solid time. Here I saw the workings of the mystery of iniquity and the abominations that are in the earth, the seeds of desolation, and one of the strongholds of sin and Satan. It made me think of the Sodomites and sins of Sodom. We lodged at <persName key="w6nk4g54">T. Scattergood's</persName>.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-23"><dateline><date when="1788-03-23">23.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. After considerable struggling of thoughts about going to Frankford meeting, the way seemed to open clear for I to go and <persName key="w6c931wj">Deborah Basit</persName> to go with me. This is the place where <persName key="w6kf2phb">Thomas Chalkley</persName> formerly lived near this meeting house. It appeared to be a poor little cold starved place, but few burden bearers, but Deborah had lively good service. But I could not please myself as at some times. We dined at <persName key="w6xx5995">John Roberts's</persName>. Had a sitting to satisfaction and so returned to town and though we were caught in a shower, All was well and seemed right. This Deborah is a precious innocent sweet spirited creature and this time had a tendency to nearly and sweetly to unite us.</p>
<p>This evening, I was at bank meeting. <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James Thornton</persName> and <persName key="w6427nc6">William Savery</persName> was highly favored, the last in prayer but it was a distressing time with me. Had taken some cold numbness and pain in the Head though I believe it was a highly favored time with many and mine ear received a little thereof before it was over. Lodged at Scattergood's.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-24"><dateline><date when="1788-03-24">24.</date></dateline><p> Select Meeting met again at 8. Committee reported as their sense the several public meetings were favored. A certificate was produced for <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James Thorington</persName> to visit Friends in Europe which was signed with great unanimity and freedom. Adjourned till three afternoon. Went to Pine Street. <persName key="w6c931wj">Debe Basset</persName> had good service. Likewise <persName key="w6kx66c3">Peter Yarnall</persName> and William Matthews.</p>
<p>Select Meeting met again. <persName key="w6427nc6">William Savery</persName> had most uncommon service, extensive council to ministers and elders. Likewise <persName key="w6rk58z8">John Lloyd</persName> and <persName key="w6wq14dj">Samuel Emlen</persName>. It appeared I thought that Friends were journeying forward, though poverty does so much abound in the little meetings up and down.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Relieved of the pain in my head remarkably.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-25"><dateline><date when="1788-03-25">25.</date></dateline><p> Came up to our meeting on foot. Blind <persName key="w63s1j4g">Solomon Gaskill</persName>, Abner Rogers walked with us. <persName key="w6d59f93">Thomas Vickers</persName> was at our meeting but was silent. I thought <persName key="w63s1j4g">Solomon</persName> and I came off pretty well satisfactory.</p></div>
<pb n="004" facs="334755"/>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-26"><dateline><date when="1788-03-26">26th of the Third Month, 1788.</date></dateline><p> Went to the burial of <persName key="w6d01xtv">Darling Conrow</persName>. <persName key="w63s1j4g">Solomon Gaskill</persName> went with us from Moorestown. I hope it was a pretty solid time and the more so for our being there, both having considerable to say at the house, one at the grave this afternoon. <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs>, <persName key="w6bv9xp3">Joseph Warrington</persName> and I went to see <persName key="w6qj854r">Joseph Buzby</persName>, to all appearance near his end. We could have no conversation with him further than this, when we bid him fare well he had strength enough to call our names bid us fare well and said I wish you all well.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Dined at <persName key="w6jr1rg4">Joshua Bispham's</persName>. Had a sitting with the heads of the family to some relief.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-03-27"><dateline><date when="1788-03-27">27.</date></dateline><p> Got home about noon and made greatest part of a plow for A. Nichol.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1788-03-30"><dateline><date when="1788-03-30">30.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day at our meeting and I thought there was something pretty lively and smart for us.

The inhabitance met scatteringly which was a hurt and the expectation of the people a great deal too much outward. Afterwards, a spirit that I thought should be famished. <persName key="w63s1j4g">Solomon Gaskill</persName> was there and had considerable to say but it was a lowish time with me. I could not feel that raised into dominion which my soul longed for, however I thought there was something at last a little lively and Friends concluded on comparing notes that the meeting ended well. I remember J.C. words were, well John, all is well that ends well. I believe there is a little remnant of well minded people there and divers expressed great satisfaction with the meeting. One was at our house a few days after and had a pretty deal to say about the meeting. Said he should be glad to have one every First Day there.</p></div>

<p>However when business was entered upon, I think I have not seen of late more of the creaturely part in transacting the business. Hammering work.

<p>I think never before seen the aptness and danger of falling into rule and form. Time past, all that gave papers for outgoing in marriage were received, now all disowned. Let the state of men be ever so different if the life is not kept to. If we go at all, then rule or form is followed here. I believe many, not only individuals but whole societies, have fell and suffered great loss even after knowing great and good beginning. As <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> mentions some who were for a time a burning and a shining light and being confident and confirmed their beginning was right, I believe many societies and sects of people have degenerated into the form without the life and so have been building up a babble from age to age and generation to generation and this I believe hath spread through whole nations. It is much easier to mankind or creaturely will to walk by form and rule than to keep to the dictates of the spirit of Truth within. Whilst we keep to that we have a safe guide but when we don't keep to that, rule and form is directly sought for, and oh! what mountains of human inventions have men raised up of forms and rules in religion, which is but form and fruitless speculation!</p></div>

<p>The rest of this week about home tending corn. About two plows for Joseph Stiles. I heard this week of people eastward grinding oats to make bread and of their making potato bread. The Hessian Fly and hard frost hath destroyed the wheat in many places especially eastward. I heard a letter read giving an account that the frost had been harder than any could remember in Chester County. The wheat killed, so that without a favorable summer they despair of bread. But wheat hath been low here, 6 s[hillings] bushel. What ups and downs. <persName key="w6rk58z8">John Lloyd</persName> told me for six miles with [?] them hard is the seed of wheat.</p></div>

Poverty and lukewarmness, indifference and ease was complained of by the little preachers and one recommended a care not to rob God this afternoon by applying the time to please ourselves which is set apart for his service and for divine meditation, which I endeavored to practice in reading the Scriptures this afternoon and other good books but seem to have no appetite for any till most night. Tasted of one and of another till I found this in <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn's</persName> <title>Select Works,</title> page 250: 1. From Diogenes his constant scholar and Friend take this one very true and notable saying: of spiritual exercitation Laertius makes him speak to this purpose in his account of his doctrine, that where men's souls are deeply and frequently employed in that spiritual retirement and waiting for divine strength and are after exercised in meditation upon the eternal mind, holy revelations, or illuminations will occur which enlighten the soul and enable it the better to like and act virtuously. Now see Isaiah XL: 31, and Psalms XXV and 14.

It so fell out that a needle in her daughter-in-law's sleeve pricked her arm and it soon began to be painful, swelled and mortified and killed her and in a few days. Some few months ago in that neighborhood or that way towards new mills I was told of a man that scratched his arm with a pin in his sleeve loading wood, and it killed him in a very few days. A Dutch man servant to Robert Stiles some years ago was whittling a bit of cedar one First Day morning making a plaything for one of the children, pricked his wrist with his knife, it soon mortified had his arm cut off but it killed him in a few days. Thomas A Kempis speaking of the uncertainty of time and the slender thread our lives seems to hang upon, says, which the least crumb or fly may put an end to. </p></div>

This John Hollinshead had got in debt, involved in difficulty, gave way to discouragement and so to despair and thought he was not worthy of the necessaries of life and so refused to eat and so starved three weeks and took nothing for part of the time but what they forced down him but eat a little before he died. It was thought that serving constable office was a great hurt to him. I think I scarcely ever saw a poorer corpse. He complained of no other disorder but trouble of mind. Starved to death.</p>

Christ hath done both and hath commended unto us the word of faith, which also is abundantly declared unto us, in his word written so that hereafter if we walk earnestly in this way to the searching out of the truth it is not to be doubted but through the certain benefit of Christ's spirit which he hath promised unto his we may find it and obtain everlasting life. should men ask council of the dead for the living faith?

<p>See Ellis Pugh's <title>Salutation to the Britons</title>, page [indecipherable]. It is there said three of his children died in one month in the flower of their age who from their youth walked orderly and hopeful. He mourned not as one without hope 1708. See Chalkley's <title>Journal,</title> page 265, in the year 1734, an account of his only son's decease. He was a lad much inclined to read the Holy Scriptures and other good books, especially religious ones etc. And see <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn's</persName> account of his son. Sorrow and joy in the loss and end of spring, Penn, page 51. He died in his one and twentieth year. See the excellent account of these youth's 1696 and see James Gough <title>Journal</title>, page 117, an account of his oldest son, worth reading. He died soon after the 26 of the Tenth Month, 1769. A young man and bright example, a complete pattern in every virtue that (says the author) I have heard many in London and Bristol say they never saw one of his years like him.

<p>But what am I about here or where might I stop when I look round and consider what incitement to watchfulness and fear and humility! How many instances might be collected of not only youth being snatched away in the prime of life, but no age exempt from death, nor no station in the church (see Job I chapter and 19 verse) – parents from children and children from parents. There comes disorders about that strips off sometimes children almost and sometimes quite whole families and sometimes the parents. Instances: there have been many both being taken away near together, the pleurisy, fevers, the small pox, the measles, the sore throat and flux and perhaps numberless numbers of other disorders which far as I can see the best of people are not exempt from. William Abit died and Hannah Lippincott both of dismal cancer, worthy good Friends. I have been told that John Estaugh was struck with the apoplexy once as he was speaking in Haddonfield meeting, but recovered it. But see a Collection of Memoirs, page 188, Robert Jordan was suddenly summoned with a fit of the apoplexy and from the account few ever better prepared or any that have been more industrious and more eminently engaged in their great Master's cause.<note type="editorial">Journal as published in Friends Miscellany either quoting from a different version of the passage, or with sweeping editorial license replaces <q>I have been told that John Estaugh...Great masters Cause</q> with <q>How suddenly many are removed by apoplexy and other diseases!</q> 251.</note></p>

<p>O what, not only lists of such instances, but whole volumes might be noted and collected which loudly calls for humility fear and preparation.</p>
<p>But if we take a more extensive view and see how people in days past have been swept away by thousands in heaps in times of war in many ages and many nations. See 2 Kings 19:35: In the camp of the Assyrians an hundred and fourscore and five thousands smote in one night and see Isaiah 37:36. In the time of the plague in London how many thousands swept away? Near 100,000 they say, in a little time. Read now the 39 of Isaiah, the 12 verse to the 31 and again in another way, by way of persecution. See the 11 of Hebrews, 37 verse, They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted were slaid with the sword, they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute, afflicted, tormented. And of more latter time, since the time of Daniel and the tyranny in Rome, Shadreck, Masheck and Abednego and Nero's days. But in Queen Mary's reign how many thousands were burned and since the sufferings of Friends in New and Old England. O what a world of wickedness this is!</p>

<p>I have heard years past some tell a little of the massacre in France but now I have the opportunity of seeing in Foxe, <title>Acts and Monuments</title> what dismal work there was. In Queen Mary's reign about religion in England abundance were burned, racked, tortured, whipped and famished in prison and not only in England but in many other nations the like persecution and cruelty was committed. The author says in the conclusion of his narrative, page 931, Thus have we taken a view of the extreme afflictions and oppressions of the reformed churches in many parts of France wherein, within a few weeks well nigh thirty thousand were [illegible] put to death 1572. Next the author says, Now in the year 1573 many places where the faithful were fled for refuge, were assailed by open war. Namely, in the first place that of Sancerre, the history whereof you have here in a short view presented, in France being besieged with five hundred horsemen and about five thousand footmen. The 9th of January 1573 with their deliverance being (saith the story) compassed about with irreconcilable enemies</p>
<pb n="015" facs="334766"/>
<p>From about the beginning of April, the want of victuals having caused them to gather together all the asses and mules they had in the city, they were eaten up in less than a month. Then they came to horses, cats, rats, moles, mice and dogs. After these were spent they fell to ox and cowhides, sheepskins, parchment, old shoes, bullock and horses hoofs, horn and lanthorns, ropes and horse harness, leather girdles etc.</p>
<p>In the end of June the third part of the besieged had not bread to eat, such as could get hemp seed, ground it and stamped it in mortars and made bread of it. The like they did with all sorts of herbs mingling the same with bran if they had it. There they eat meal of chaff, nutshells and of state, excrements of horses and men. Yea the offal which lay in the streets was not spared. The nine and twentieth of July, a poor man and his wife were executed for having eaten the head, brains, and entrails of a young child about three years old which died of hunger, having made ready the other parts to eat at another meal. An old woman lodging in the house, eating a part of this mournful diet died in prison within a few hours after her imprisonment.</p>
<p>They were found guilty of other offences: but this aggravated the same the more all children under twelve years of age died, it was lamentable to hear the pitiful voices uttered by poor parents for the misery wherein their eyes beheld their languishing and dying infants.</p>
<p>To which purpose you may take notice here of a memorable accident a boy of ten years old being ready to yield up the ghost, seeing his father and mother weeping over him (whose arms and legs when they handled them, felt as if they had been dried sticks* said unto them wherefore weep ye thus, in seeing me famished to death? Mother said he, I ask you no bread, I know you have none: but seeing it is God's will I should or must die this death, let us be thankful for it. Did not the holy man Lazarus die of famine? Have I not read it in my Bible? In uttering these and the like speeches he yielded up the ghost the 30th day of July.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Now see Lamentations 4:8.</note>
<p>That all the people died not of famine in the end of this month it was by reason of certain horses which were reserved for service if need should be, and six kine which were left to give milk for sustenance of young infants. These beasts were killed and their flesh sold for the sustenance or relief of such as were living, with a little corn, which by stealth some brought into the city, so that a pound of wheat was sold for half a crown.</p>
<p>There died by fight in Sancerre but eighty-four persons, but of famine more than five hundred. Many soldiers getting forth as they could out of the city flying from the famine chose rather to die by the sword of the enemy, wherefore some were slain, others imprisoned, and the rest put to death by the executioner.</p>
<p>But when all help of men failed, the king having sworn he would make them eat up one another, the King of Kings delivered them by his wonderful providence, for at this instant the ambassador from Poland came into France to accept the Duke of Anjou for their king at whose entreaty (which could not well be denied) poor Sancerre, more than half famished was now set at liberty by raising the siege, who otherwise were determined to leave their bones there rather than yield themselves into their enemies hands. In regard they had often threatened them with a general massacre, whereas now, by the king's appointment they were permitted to pass out of the city armed, if any would terry, that they should not be molested, having liberty granted them to dispose of their affairs as they pleased, with promises of conserving the honor and chastity as well of virgins as of women etc.</p>
<p>Now let us come to the city of Rochelle which being at this instant strongly besieged by the forces of France both by the sea and land, with about forty and fifty thousand men, was yet in the end also delivered, though not without many hot conflicts, by the immediate hand of God namely thus: the ambassador of Poland arriving in France the seventeenth day of June, a truce was made on the sudden, ar<pb n="016" facs="334767"/>
ticles of peace drawn and sent to the king who consented to them and sent answer in for an edict granting to those of Rachel, Montauban, Nismes and others which stood upon their defense, liberty for the exercises of their religion, the rest to live peaceably in their houses and therein to minister the sacrament of baptism and marriage as they had want to do, so as their assemblies exceeded not the number of ten besides the parents.</p>
<p>He restored to Rochellers and others the rights and privileges, letting fall all the decrees given out against approving of their defensive war, giving them leave, according to their ancient custom to retain in their cities, towers and fortresses men and munitions, yea to receive in governor among them provided that they were such as they had no cause to suspect or except against.</p>
<p>By virtue of this edict, upon the tenth of July about ten of the clock in the forenoon, the Sieur of Biron entered into the city at the gate called de-Coigne, with an herald of arms, and four of the kings' trumpeters, at which hour peace was proclaimed in the most eminent places thereof accompanied with the lieutenant of city and with the lord of villiers after which dining at the major's house he soon after retired, being conducted along till he came without the city.</p>
<p>The same day many small vessels laden with biscuits, corn, meal, fish, and other provisions entered into the haven.</p>
<p>At this siege the Duke of D: Amaule lost his life, with Cosseins who had broken into the admiral's lodging and began the massacre at Paris, besides many great lords, gentlemen, captains, lieutenants, ancients to the number of threescore the great part of which having their hands imbued in those others massacres, being come thither received their reward. Namely either present death or wounds so incurable or wounds so incurable that they escaped not with life.</p>

<p>One* thing ought not here to be passed over in silence, to wit, the provision of victuals which God furnished this besieged people with all when all other provisions began to fail them, namely an infinite number of small fishes never seen before in that haven, which every day yielded themselves to the mercy of the necessitous inhabitants. But as soon as the edict was published and the Rochelers set at liberty by the arriving of the Polish ambassadors, these sea fish withdrew themselves.</p>

<p>Although this relation following, touching another siege of this city of Rochelle suits nothing at all with the order of time, happening as it did in the year 1628, yet for as much as it seems to me to have some affinity with the terrible famine, wherewith both the City of Sancerre and it were affected, let not the reader be offended for placing the same here somewhat out of place being a thing so worthy of note:</p>
<p>An extract of a letter written on board the Saint George his Majesty's ship in Saint George's Islands.</p>
<p>There died in this siege of Rochelle the 30 of October 1628 sixteen thousand persons. The rest endured a world of miseries, most of their food being hides leather and old gloves other provisions being very scarce were at an excessive rate: viz. a bushel of XX Ii. A pound of bread XX s[hillings]; A quarter of mutton vi: 18 old money; a pound of butter XXX s[hillings]; an egg VIII s[hillings]; an ounce of sugar II s[hillings] vi d[pence]; a dried fish XX s[hillings]; a pound of grapes XII s[hillings]; a pint of milk XXX s[hillings]. Also it is reported, that through the famine young maids of fourteen or sixteen years of age did look like old women of a hundred years old. The famine was such that the poor people would cut off the buttocks of the dead as they lay in the church yard unburied. All the English that came out looked like anatomies. They lived two months mice frogs being all spent. And this with a world of other miseries did they suffer, in hope of being relieved by others. Thus much I thought good to let you understand</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Read the 6 and 7 chapter 2 Kings: Ass's head and dove's dung sold.</note>
<note type="authorial" place="right margin"> See 2 Kings 6:25: Doves dung sold in siege Samaria.</note>
<pb n="017" facs="334768"/>
<p>Now it is likely many would hardly believe this account, but let us a little consider that the scriptures testify concerning such thing. See 2 Kings 6:2, And it came to pass after this that Ben Hadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up and Besieged Samaria and there was a great famine in Samaria and behold they besieged it until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a Cab of doves dung for fives pieces of silver, and as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord a king and he said if the Lord do not help the whence shall I help the out of the barn floor or out of the wine press, and the king said unto her what aileth the, and she answered, this woman said unto me, give thy son that we may eat him today and we will eat my son tomorrow, so we boiled my son and did eat him and she hath hid her son. But see in the next chapter 7th 2 Kings how remarkably they were delivered.</p>
<p>Now see Jeremiah lamenting Jerusalem's misery, Lamentations Chapter 11:19: Arise, cry out in the night, in the beginning of the watch pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord. Lift up thy hands towards him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street. Behold a Lord and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long. Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord. 4 chapter 9 verse: They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken though for want of the fruits of the field. 10: The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children. They were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p>Now see in early time this was threatened in Deuteronomy 28 chapter where we may see blessing promised for obedience and curses for disobedience. 52 verse: And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced wall come down wherein thou trustest. 53: And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and thy daughters which the Lord thy God hath given there in the siege and in the straightness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee. Read 58 verse and 59 verse following aye the whole chapter.</p>
<p>We read in Ezekiel 14 and 21 of four sore judgments: the sword, the famine, the noisome beast and pestilence, but as <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> remarks our land hath not yet been visited with famine as other nations in ages past. Although we have had broad signs and threatening prospects of it many times divers ways and especially in some besieged places in the times of the last war, we have as yet but had a taste of these things in comparison to what hath been known in scripture. I think there is above fifty places mention made of famine and between thirty and forty of pestilence. Although the stroke was heavy on many last war, in many places great desolation. Many thousands lost their lives one way or other many forced into exile to Nova Scotia. But how we forget it.</p>

<p>It appears from some chronological accounts of curious inquirers who have taken a view of the bulk of mankind as a family at large that the human species rather increase than decrease, notwithstanding the number that are and have been destroyed by wars and removed by death other ways and that upon the best computation that those curious ingenious inquirers are able to make of the number of mankind now on the globe. (And as was mentioned by the prophet, All flesh is as grass which withereth and one crop dies and gives way for another,<note type="editorial">1 Peter 1:24</note> so it is with mankind one generation passes away and another comes.) These searchers and calculators have concluded on the whole that consequently eighty one thousand seven hundred must die and six two die every day.</p>
<p>John Foxe the author of the <title>Books of Martyrs</title> hath these word at the conclusion of his 3rd volume, page 959, which he terms a true declaration of the massacre of Voltolines.</p>
<p><q>Therefore it appeareth most clearly every way that the aforesaid persons underwent those sufferings for no other cause, but only for the truth of the Gospel even as by the eternal decree of God, the holy prophets, Saint John Baptist, the holy apostles, yea even our Lord, and head, Jesus Christ himself and after him those many millions of the elected martyrs in all ages have done before, and especially in these miserable last times in Germany, France, England, Scotland, low Countries, Bohemia, Italy, Spain, Portugal etc.</q></p>
<note type="authorial" place="right margin"> 20 of the Twelfth Month, 1789. I have an author [Arthur] O'Leary, <title>[An Essay] On Toleration, </title>says, page the 8th persecution has thinned the world of fifty millions of human beings.</note>
<p>Which martyrdom they endured willingly, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer blame for the name of Christ Jesus remembering the promise of this our Lord, blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake, because the kingdom of heaven is theirs. Blessed are you when others shall revile and persecute you and shall falsely speak all evil of you for my sake. Rejoice and triumph, for your reward is great in heaven for so have they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
<p>Read to this purpose, 1 Peter 4:12-16 which word of all good Christians are to be well pondered and weighed. For first by such trial we perish not. Secondly we are thereby made conformable to Christ our Head. Thirdly such sufferings cause unto us greater joy than sorrow. Fourthly they are infallible marks that the spirit of God rests upon us. Fifthly they manifest to all our unfeigned love to Christ and his Gospel. Sixthly, hereby we have good proof that the Lord doth correct us, not as a severe judge but as a loving and most tenderhearted father to whom therefore with his blessed son and Holy Spirit be all glory and honor ascribed in all the churches of the saints, world without end. Amen.</p>
<p>Book of Martyrs, page 488, John Philpot's Martyrs,<note type="editorial">Philpot is one of the martyrs. In examination he was asked how old his religion was. Answered it is older than yours, a thousand years. The examiner says, I pray you, where was it fifty years ago? Philpot says, It was in Germany apparent by the testimony of Hus, Hieronymus of Prague and Wicklif [sic] whom your generation an hundred years ago and more did burn for preaching the truth unto you and before their time and since hath been, although under persecution it hath been put to silence. And then next he alludes to the passage where it is mentioned that the true church should be driven into the wilderness and suffer great persecution. This reference to John Philpot's testimony in 1555 as recorded in John Foxe's Acts and Monuments; this book was frequently reprinted and the edition used by Hunt has not been identified.</note></p>

A Friend told me that he had tried the dog, the fowls and the hogs and they would not eat of it, that they would take it in their mouths and put it out again, that it lay in the hogs' trough several days and they would not eat it. Now how have our foolish nation for the sake of gain sent out the wheat to sea and had rum in exchange which make so many sick and vomit.

Joshua expressed great satisfaction with my company and appeared to be much favored with a composed resigned mind at parting. I said I hoped he would be spared a while longer with us and that his affliction would tend to his further refinements. He answered and said he had not felt afraid to die and felt peace of mind which had supported and enable him to bear his great pains and expressed the value of that peace at such a time that it was more than all this world could afford and expressed the clear sight he had of the looking too much to doctors at such a time what a tendency it had to unsettle the mind.</p>

Was at Evesham Meeting which was very dull at first and grew worse and worse (through my backwardness) for a time but ended better. This afternoon <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> and <persName key="w6jx3293">Thomas Lippincott</persName> and I went on to my uncle <persName key="w6hf8m7k">John Harvey</persName>.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-10-24"><dateline><date when="1788-10-24">24.</date></dateline><p> Set forward toward Shrewsbury. Fell in company with <persName key="w6rk58z8">John Lloyd</persName> and divers others Pennsylvania Friends. We rode through Freehold, as it is called where there was the large farms and fields that ever I seen in my life by far. <persName key="w6rk58z8">John Lloyd</persName> said he had seen those fields at this time of year covered with wheat and fat cattle, but now there is very little seed for harvest put in and but little Indian Corn. The Hessian fly amongst the wheat and the worms and lice amongst the Indian Corn seems to have laid this country desolate. Their farms in miserable fence and the timber very much destroyed and gone. Freehold being much inhabited by the Dutch, it was thought that their intention was to fence their farms with hedge and white thorn. Some of thorn I seen but a death amongst the hedge a few years ago cut off their prospect that way so that this with these armies of reptiles, flies, lice, frost and blasting spreads a melancholy prospect, for they have no wheat but what they get from York. We lodged at Edmund Williams.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1788-10-25"><dateline><date when="1788-10-25">25.</date></dateline><p> We went to Select Meeting at Shrewsbury which I thought was but low, yet ended more lively.

This afternoon <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> and I were invited to sit with a number of Select Members, a committee on Schools. They seemed under a lively concern but have as yet got forward but little. We lodged at Joseph Wardel's.</p></div>

We went down to the shore and crossed Shrewsbury River to lodge with Robert Hartshorn, an elder and father in the church. We went this afternoon atop of a very high mountain where we had a prospect of the great ocean whose waters came to the foot of the vast high steep mountain. We stood on after we came down. This evening we had a sweet opportunity with the family. Sarah Lunde, a worthy minister and her husband being with us and was much favored. After we went to bed I remembered a dream I had a few weeks ago. I dreamed that I was got on an exceeding high mountain and looked down and it seemed awful to see a great lake or water. With several other things, nearly as I saw in the dream seemed to come to pass.</p></div>

I had one evening some solid conference with him. He said if the fever continued it would soon fetch him down. I said there was not much in this world to tempt us to stay here he answered, O! no the greatest in the world would not tempt me (not that alone). My way, says he, has been much shut up of late. It seemed as if I could not see far before me. I have been concerned to get something in this world but I think I never craved much, yet maybe too much. It is a great thing to be resigned in everything. I said I hoped there was not much in his way if it should be so ordered that he should be taken from us. He mentioned some weaknesses that had attended him but said he felt nothing to lay heavy on his mind but said he was much resigned though said maybe I am insensible. He mentioned the sick soldiers some years ago and said poor creatures, poor creatures we are and afterwards said he had endeavoured to conduct right of latter time.</p></div>

The meeting was somewhat favored and solid. The people after dinner was sober and orderly as is common to say but a right spirit not prevalent, according to my mind. The worldly conversation too much prevailed, so the way did not open for a solid sitting and we did not experience our water turned into wine as they of Cana of Galilea.</p></div>

A door of utterance was opened and it was, I doubt not, a favored time with many and I believe generally speaking solid good meeting, but to me it was a time trial and close striping and poverty.</p>
<p>This afternoon my brother <persName key="w66b7v5c">Robert Hunt</persName> and I came over Potomac River towards Pipe Creek. Lodged at Richard Richardson's, near old Manoquancy meeting house where my cousin <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> was born.

I thought it was but a poor time though a pretty deal said. This afternoon we had a meeting at Woodsburough to very good satisfaction. A solid favored time. I got some acquaintance with Isaac Everett a great minister and father in our Israel. His company and conversation was very edifying and comforting. We rode 42 miles and had two meetings. I lodged at Moses Forquhair's.</p></div>

<p>Select Meeting met again.

<p>Next Yearly Meeting met at 10 at which setting our business respecting the arrangement of the meetings was concluded with great unanimity. Met again at 4th hour.

When it came nearly right over us, it thundered very hard. There seemed to be two claps that struck, however one struck a walnut tree at G. Githin's and struck the shop that stood very near the tree, set the shop on fire. They soon put it out and it did but little damage. It stunned and very much surprised several in and near the house. There was no rain in the cloud and I think it must have went three-quarters of a mile from the cloud to the shop.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago when I was in Virginia I seen a letter from William Dikson at Redstone giving an account of his son about 19 being killed with the thunder the 15th of the Fifth Month last as he sat at dinner with others of the family. His mother and sister were gone to meeting. He was not perceived to breath after he was struck down. A dog under the table yelped out and went out of the house and laid down and died immediately.</p>
<p><persName key="w66b7v3g">Elizabeth Atkinson</persName> informed me that up at the Black Horse or near there three boys went to a well to drink. Drawed some water and one handed the cup to the other, and then thunder struck the well pole and killed one of the boys in the spot.</p>

To my satisfaction it appeared that a lively concern was spreading with respect to the advice of the Yearly Meeting tending to discourage the use of spirituous liquors.

In his testimony, he spoke much to and closely warned and cautioned the youth and mentioned a very alarming instance of four young people being buried in one grave to which he said he was lately an eye witness and said they had just before been solemnly warned at such a meeting as this.</p>
<p>The case, as I was afterwards informed, was this: A company of young people after the Quarterly Meeting at Rahway went out in a party of pleasuring and for recreation went to the sea shore as it was said. Seven of them went at low water along the shore to gather little sea shells. They at entering on the sand bar at low water had crossed a low place and, whilst they were diverting themselves along the shore, the tide arose so high that it prevented their getting across the low place, the tide or the sea coming in very rapidly and no boat of relief could be had. At this surprising prospect, it is said, they screamed and cried out most grievously, the young women clinging fast to one young man that was with them and so seven of them were drowned and four of them taken up. A part of the clothes said to be found of the others and supposed the bodies of them were eaten by sharks.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> It is said one young man swam ashore and was saved.</note>
<p>This seemed to revive in memory several instances of some at different times being drowned going to the beach at Egg Harbor.</p>
<p>Last Seventh Day Silas Applegate of Ancocas went to market and was taken very suddenly with a pain in his head and Ears and died on First Day night. They say his ears turned black and purged.

His last wife died a few years ago. He continuing in drunkenness and very self willed. At last, as was said, refused to go to bed.

John said we could not buy peace too dear and concerning keeping our covenants and amongst our friends neighbor and in our families how great a thing it was to maintain the unity and the way to do it was to keep faithfully our covenants, for if we lost that badge of discipleship we lost all.</p>
<p>I came home this evening. Brother <persName key="w6r525r2">Aaron</persName> was relating a singular instance, viz., one Joseph Woolston who had a few years ago been a captain in the wars, a carpenter by trade and a very drunken profligate man. A few weeks ago came home on Seventh Day night from his work very drunk and as usual very abusive to his wife and family next night was taken very ill. After lying a few days he begun to be much alarmed with death and appeared much surprised and very penitent. He sent for a Methodist, a Negro man whom he had derided, to pray for him, which he did. Near the last of the week he sent for one to make his will, but when the man came he said it was too late he could not do any thing at it. He appeared all along to the very last very sensible after desiring his brother to take care of his business and his wife and children and his effects etc. He seemed always in prayer and desired them about him to pray for him especially the last day or two. A few hours before he went of he asked what o'clock it was. When he was told he said (naming the hour) at such an hour I shall go off and be with Christ and died exactly as he had said.</p>

One shot to my satisfaction. More humility, circumspection and reverent care I see is wanting.</p>
<p>John Morton, one of our neighbors, was buried whilst I was at the Yearly Meeting. I had been several times to see him whilst he was sick, which was but a few weeks. When he was first taken amiss, his wife one First Day after meeting came to me and asked me to come and see her husband and said he seemed very poorly, but could hardly tell what ailed him, only said he seemed low in his mind. Next day I went to see him and found him very humble and weighty in his spirit. After some conversation he said, O John I am not sick like a dying man, but I believe the Lord has a mind to stop me. He seemed tender and weighty. I advised him to labor for a state of resignation and to endeavor to keep his mind stayed on the Lord. Ah, said he, it's an easy thing to talk of, but it's a hard thing for such a one as I to come to it. I am now going on towards sixty year old. I have been this forty years now in the wide world in all manner of wickedness, drunkenness and whoring etc. I went again and he told me he never expected to go out of his room till he was carried out. I told him that must be a solemn awful prospect. He said he did not desire to continue here any longer, that he was now only waiting to be prepared. He said it seemed as if all that ever he did came before him, things that he never expected to think of any more come into his mind. I told [him] I thought it was a good sign and that it was the good remembrances that was near who told the woman of Samaria all that ever she did. I have a hope of his being one of the happy number whose sins go beforehand to judgment, as we read some men's go beforehand to judgment.</p>
<p>And some follow after I told him we had been favored with a good meeting, he said he was glad to hear it and wished it might continue.</p>
<p>Now whilst I write this I hear of the death of Hannah Allen, daughter of Anthony. A lusty fat healthy young woman in the bloom of life between eighteen and twenty years old. Died with the measles.</p>

What lessons of instruction many ways and yet how we forget them. One taken away on one side and another one, one of one disorder and another another, one of a pleurisy another of a consumption, ulcers and cancers and accidents many ways and some yea many make way with themselves. Some conduct so as to get hanged – one tried last week for his life – and many now a days go crazy, lose their reason. A sorrowful instance at present of a neighbor's son Joseph Coles, lost his reason and like to have killed several in probability, so that he is now confined. A very hopeful young man hanged himself.

<p>Joseph Coles, a comely hopeful youth, has now lost his reason – again – so that they are forced to keep him chained and many such scenes of sorrow we hear of nowadays, but people choosing rather to go to the house of mirth than to the house of mourning. They seem to be soon forgotten, but were the accounts of such sorrowful instances cast together what a volume they would make.</p>
<p>There was James Hollen and Uriah Moor died in that crazy condition lately. Some years ago John Matlack, after being kept chained several years died and his sister died crazy and their mother not quite right in her mind. N. Middleton's wife died quite raving distracted. John Inskeep's daughter, a comely young woman, being crossed in love quite lost her reason and Rachel Woolman and her sister P. Moor but she is got better. There was one Moses Haines run about many years crazy; it was supposed was killed at last. A. Hewlings sent to the hospital for a time. Got some better, but far from being right in his mind yet. And there is Jonas French and one J. Fish at this time very much disordered in mind. Some years ago Ephraim Stiles arose and heard of several more but this is but just a few that now occurs at the hospital there are great numbers seemingly in the most sorrowful crazy condition. John Hollinshead – I had like to forgot – through some cross occurrences gave way to despair, lost his reason, refused to eat and starved himself to death. There was some lost their reason by fits, viz. W. Warrington and now one in Evesham, William Snowdon's son, a young man.</p></div>

<p>The 4th of last month there was a hard thundershower and a terrible hurricane which blew down George Githin's chimney. It broke through the roof floor and all and narrowly missed of killing several of them, though but one was hurt. Last summer their shop was struck with the thunder and sat on fire. It was but about a year ago Ann Morton's chimney blew down in a time of a hurricane broke, through the kitchen roof floor and all and narrowly missed killing her.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1790-11-27"><dateline><date when="1790-11-27">1790 27 of the Eighth Month.</date></dateline><p> There was a most uncommon hard wind in Pennsylvania, a thunder show which made most ruinous work. I think the like I hardly ever heard of in our parts. Killed some creature, tore up orchards, blew down buildings, and blew some parts of buildings, as it was said, some miles.</p>
<pb n="062" facs="334813"/>
<p>We have had a very exceeding great fruit year of all sorts of fruit, apples in particular. I never saw the like and I believe there never was so many at one season before. A general complaint for want of casks to hold cider. The apples kept very sound and hung on the trees full till very late and the ground covered with apples in some places till the snow came, which was 27th of the Eleventh Month 1790.</p>
<p>When I was at Christopher Smith's, on our return from Salem Quarterly Meeting several Friends were telling of a great death amongst their apple trees. Several young orchards, they said, were almost all dead or likely to go with a kind of a worm of something at the roots. Some years ago the fruit, especially the apples, were blasted by one means or other in many places. The rose bugs eat up the young apples so that for many years together there was but very little fruit, not apples for house use, so that some said they that had no orchards were better of than them that had for they had none to cumber the ground. But now there is not casks to be had to hold the cider and abundance they get distilled, make molasses of it, let the creatures eat them and yet now in places abundance of choice sound apples under the snow. So we are tried both with plenty and with scarcity. O that we might learn like the apostle how to behave when we abound and otherwise.</p>
<p>We have had a pretty good season for grain and some here away have very good crops, but at Salem John Wister tells me they had a very dry summer especially the forepart and on places there about much complaint of the louse in the Indian corn. Some fields I heard of almost whole field being destroyed with the worms like pismires [?] and much complaint of the birds: crows and blackbird. With some of these thing one piece of ours was so hurt in the Spring that it was not more than half a crop.</p></div>

The women were highly favored. Mary especially was raised in great eminence, with good demonstration, life and power. The stream and main stress of their testimony was against a worldly spirit and a state of carnal security in own society. Scarcely a word to the drunkards and profligates. Likewise at Haddonfield, verse. they had very close tight scraping work. Jane said the people were so taken up with their worldly schemes and earthly concerns that it seemed as if they had forgotten they must die or that they had but a little time to stay here on earth. Mary began with this saying, We are ready to say sometimes, by whom shall Jacob arise for he is small<note type="editorial">Amos 7</note> and so went on in a lively powerful manner. Jacob, she said, was so little in his own eyes that he said he was a worm and no man and signified it was the case with some now a days. Now worms, she said, was a thing that was frequently trod upon* and some were so cruel in their nature that they delighted to tread upon them and would tread them to death. <persName key="w6nk4g54">Thomas Scattergood</persName> had also very good service</p>

The boy got lost behind me. His horse got out in the swamp and a time of most dreadful thunder and lightning it was. After a time of blowing the horn and going out with the candle we got the lad home, but the dreadfulness of the thunder increased until midnight. It was really an humbling awful time to me. Very rare to see the like so early in the season.</p>

<p>I was informed that M. Ridgeway and J. Watson was very much affected with this time of thunder. It is said its not common to see the like in their land.</p>

And further she said a fear had possessed her mind least some there had been unhappily prevailed on to set up idols in their heart, in their mouths, and houses and mentioned the declension and that blindness in part had happened to Israel. Mary Berry was much on the same.</p>

<p>Whilst I was in company with <persName key="w6x16z80">John</persName> and <persName key="w6h70g88">B. Reeves</persName> they informed me that there were two men and two women drownded just before. They left home on the strand or beach or water shoals in a party of pleasuring, like them at Rahway a few years back. Walked out [illegible] that in kind of bravado got out of their depth got frightened. The women clinged fast to the men and all drowned together, some of them having children grown up and married.</p>
<p>Another thing <persName key="w6x16z80">John Reeves</persName> told me I thought worth notice concerning a man, one of his neighbors, much given to strong drink and exceeding abusive to his wife when drunk so that she seemed often in great danger of her life and frequently came to their house when he turned her out, who was much surprised by two men, as he thought, who came to him dressed in white and opened a prospect to him what would assuredly be his doom if he held on in his wicked course, which so surprised him that he betook himself to performing religious duties in the way of the Baptists and so continued very temperate and religious for two years and then broke out to drinking again. John said he thought he was one of the most profane men in language before, but after his taking to it the second time, if it was possible, he was ten times worse than before but lived not long after. Died in his bed. Nobody knew how his wife found him a corpse.</p></div>

I went to Cropwell Meeting and it was a good satisfactory meeting to divers of us. William R. says it was to him. At this meeting notice was given of the burial of John Stokes. <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> and I went to the burial and a poor shut up time it was. He was killed with a fall from a horse. As he was running of him, the horse threw him against a gate post near against our meeting house door. Broke his skull and killed him instantly. Much in drink, he was perhaps one of the greatest drunkards of his age and one of the most profane with his tongue that was ever raised in these part, though a wealthy Friends son of a reputable family. I think I never saw more hard heartedness, unfeeling, unsympathsing, insensibility prevail at a burial in my life. If the Scriptures had told us that all that die drunk and all the drunkards should Surely go to heaven it would not be so admirable.</p>
<p>When William Tallman, a young man about 21 years of age, was hanged the other day at Woodbury for robbery, I was informed it was a serious, solemn time and many were affected with tenderness, even to tears but no such thing here. And here the retailers of strong drink could come to the burial as unconcerned as the rest. O! how custom has blinded our eyes and drawn a veil or brought a thick cloud over us.</p>
<p><persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> informs me that a young man from Maryland brings straight and clear intelligence that at Maryland they have had no rain for three months and so pinched with the drought that they are forced to feed their creatures with corn to keep them from starving to death.</p></div>

No, said he, I am a Quaker, I can't fight. You a Quaker! said they. Yes, said he, I have a right. But, said they, you have not got the marks. So they took and cut off his hair for he had it tied. They cut off his cross pockets and some buttons.</note></div>

I was at our meeting and thought there was a very commendable quiet and stillness and I hope it ended pretty well. Hudson Middleton from Virginia after meeting informed me that, what with the drought and the war their grass was cut off, so that where they used to mow five hundred load of hay they would not this season now mow five load, and that R. Haines who used to mow a great deal would not mow or had not mowed a handful. And that they were driving their cattle this way to sell and had to go fifteen miles for water in places. And from some Friends from the eastward, they say that in some parts there is hundreds of acres of corn that will not produce the seed that planted it. Another account says that there is thousands of acres that will not produce five bushels to the acre. That it is not higher than a man's waistband. Surely these accounts are enough to make people look round them and consider what they have been doing with the Lord's outward blessing in times of plenty and even we here by this time should have been in a most languishing condition before now, if the pinching drought had continued till this time. But now there is abundance of choice pasture and we seem to have forgotten the threatening prospect that appeared a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Brother <persName key="w6n05cnp">Joshua Hunt</persName> was here from Redstone.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1791-09-26"><dateline><date when="1791-09-26">26.</date></dateline><p> I went down to the Yearly Meeting with him. Meeting of Business began at the 10 hour and opened in a solid manner. Proceeded to read the accounts brought up in the queries of the state of the meetings. At the close of this sitting I had one right fair shot to very good satisfaction. After meeting I met with <persName key="w6wq14dj">Samuel Emlen</persName> and he told me he was glad to hear my voice lifted up amongst them. I told him I hardly expected I could attend any more on account of <rs key="w60h49sj">my son's</rs> being so ill at home. He said, I believe thee came to do what thee did and further said, whatsoever thine hand finds to do, do it with all thy might.</p>
<p>I stayed the next sitting this afternoon which was to my satisfaction. We had some right down sharp shooting, perhaps pursuant to the command shoot at Babylon spare no arrows.<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 50: 14</note> Robert Nesbit from New England was the archer and the subject was concerning a conformity to the world and uniformity amongst ourselves, especially active members, concerning which a deficiency and want appeared in that great meeting which was looked upon to be the greatest on the continent and therefore much looked up to. For example, a certain something was closely spoken to which had been an exercise for some years past to many well concerned Friends and that was the assistant clerk who had been clerk wore cross pockets and very high collared clothes. We had a close searching time but it all settled a way quietly and the meeting went on orderly and solid, by so it is to be hoped all of it will work together for good.</p>
<p>I came home and found my poor son growing worse as to the disorder but in a very tender favored frame of mind. He expressed divers very affecting edifying exhortations and tender cautions and advice to his little sisters. He called them to him took them by the hand told them not to set their minds on fine things and said there was a great Lord who loved good children and loved to do them good, but them that set their minds on fine things the Lord did not love so well, for they mostly did bad things and said the Lord behold the proud afar off and he told them there was a good country where good people went to when they died, where they should have no more sorrow nor trouble and spoke something to them of the bad country and asked them if they thought (it was a very tendering time) they would remember what he said. One of them answered yes and said she never thought it was right.</p>
<p>The fever continued very violent which caused him to be lightheaded, unsensible at times but at this time I believe he was very sensible and asked me if I thought it was possible for such a one as he to be made fit for that glorious place concerning which it was said no unclean thing can enter. I told him I had no doubt of it, and that he had for the most part done pretty well and that I hoped he would be accepted. He said they were close sayings, where no unclean thing can enter and then expressed a desire that he might have a full clear evidence of his peace being made.</p>
<p>And then he wanted to know of me how the Yearly Meeting went or how we fared. He said perhaps not so favored as at some other times. I told him it opened solid and well and business went on well as long as I stayed. I had good satisfaction. He said he was glad to hear it and said he that it was a pity I should be hindered from the Yearly Meeting (of this he had always appeared very tender) and that he was sorry to keep me from the meeting. I signified to him I was resigned.</p>
<pb n="077" facs="334828"/>
<p>His disorder, the fever, seemed to return with greater violence (notwithstanding all that the doctor or we could do) which deprived him much of his senses yet he was sensible in part. At times would call his Friends and neighbors by their names that came to see him and showed very loving and affectionate to all of us. Once he said to me, Oh Father, * How I love thee. I love thee. I think I love thee.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> *his arms around my neck</note>
<p>His uncle <persName key="w6r525r2">Aaron Wills</persName> came to see him, but his fever was so violent he could not converse much. But yet he did ask his uncle if he thought they should ever see one another again in this world. His uncle told him he could not tell, but said he was in hopes it would be for the best if they did not.</p>
<p>His fever still seemed to rage and weaken him very fast yet I it appeared he had some right sense and knowledge of things till near the last moments: he would take drink etc. He appeared to be exceedingly afflicted and in great distress both of body and mind, till the 30 of the Ninth Month about 5 o'clock in the morning he departed this life and I hope suffered his last. 1791.</p>
<p>The day after our Quarterly Meeting William Allinson and two other young men, strangers, came to see him and he spoke to them in a very tendering affecting manner. He told William Allinson that he had thought he felt great nearness to him of late, that they had been engaged to walk together in one path or one way and desired he might persevere, with something more to that effect which seemed to have a very tendering reach on the young men. He told his mother afterwards he believed it was a favored time with them. He had during his illness several opportunities with his little brothers and sisters advising them to be good boys and said to <persName key="w64v7902">Benjamin</persName>, be a good boy and then there is nothing will hurt the hardly. Which advice was dropped in such a manner that it made very tendering impressions. Whilst I was at town he expressed himself after this manner, which was expression such a manner that his mother desired a neighbor to write it down, viz: Oh Lord, be pleased to strengthen me that I may appear before thee, with something more which she could not well recollect clearly.</p>
<p>He one day asked the doctor what he thought of him, who seemed not hasty in answering. He told the doctor he need not be afraid to speak for he had been favored not to be alarmed, and said divers times he thought he was pretty much resigned but said his fever was so hard he had not or could not think much about it. I remember in the forepart of his sickness there was some conversation passed in the room respecting great and high letter learned ministers he said the Lord is certainly able to raise up ministers without it.</p>
<p>He in the time of his illness told his little brothers that he had endeavored to set them a good example but had missed it sometimes and then had to suffer for it. As I was one day holding back in his chair whilst his bed was making, I was saying something about his having a great deal of sickness and that may be it might be for the best and work together for good he answered he had no doubt of it and said there seemed not room for a single wish. This was after I had been mentioning the affliction of Lazarus who was full of sores: and so it seemed to be with him. The doctor had laid blister plasters on him for the fever and then there came boils very bad boils near where the blisters were drawn so that he was sorely afflicted and yet bore it with great patience and said both in this and his last sickness that he had no doubt but it was all in best wisdom. So was not heard to murmur or complain. He was born [blank space left in manuscript for birthday never filled in]</p>
<p>He has been a steady youth, a near dear dutiful and affectionate child to me, of great comfort and help in my temporal affairs in taking care of my business when I was from home and tending markets for me and buying necessaries for the family, and likewise in religious matters he strengthened my hands. We often had religious conversation together when alone and on passages of Scripture in which he had a strong and clear memory, never much at a loss to find almost any passage we conversed on. I thought his judgment was beyond his years in his younger days, and his stability and steadiness superior to most of his contemporaries.</p>
<pb n="078" facs="334829"/>
<p>He has preserved a good name and I believe in good esteem among not only his intimate friends and near relations but wherever he was known, so I hope there is little or no room to doubt but that our loss is his gain and that he now rests with the righteous where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest where none of the inhabitants ever shall say I am sick, as it is mentioned by the prophet.</p></div>

<p>He told us of the weakness that had attended him ever since he had left his home and said he had not one syllable to say in the meeting. But, says he, this is my meeting and now I know what I came for, and a highly favored tendering time it was.</p></div>

<l>	For may it not without reserve be named,</l>
<l>	confirm'd apostates never were reclaimed</l>
<l>	Or have we heard or did we ever know</l>
<l>	A bold apostate solid Christian grow</l>
<l>	Yet in our pilgrimage we often find</l>
<l>	Both times of ebbing and flowings in the mind</l>
<l>	And from a want of steady watchful care</l>
<l>	Receive a wound from Satan's poisoned spear</l>
<l>	And yet not lost but be again restored</l>
<l>	And reconciled through grace to their offered Lord, etc.</l>
