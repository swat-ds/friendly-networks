                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

A savor of life and sweet solemnity attended. David Comfort a young man had something savory to communicate. She has been an innocent, tender, kind friend to all: had the care of bringing up many orphan children who always esteemed her as a mother, escaped the pollutions that are in the world was resigned and willing to leave it, and is gathered as a shock of corn in its season. Now in the midst of harvest time: though the  smaller than common.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-07-09"><dateline><date when="1812-07-09">9.</date></dateline><p> Was our monthly meeting which I thought was a lively savory satisfactory time. Had the epistle read from our yearly meeting on which was made many lively remarks. Now in the midst of harvest. Our meetings small. People work hard in the heat and are hardly in a state fit to go to meeting.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-07-15"><dateline><date when="1812-07-15">15.</date></dateline><p> <persName key="w6p953wx">Nathan Smith</persName> came to see us. </p></div>

Although very small I believe was favored in a good degree. Went to see my old friend <persName key="w6jb6xn6">Joshua Lippincott</persName>. Now we were getting in our harvest rye and wheat; favored with a very good crop, never better or more of it, scarcely a very fine harvest in general though the hail has cut down the rye in divers places. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1812-07-19"><dateline><date when="1812-07-19">19.</date></dateline><p> First Day morning. We went to see Aguila Shinn about 73 who has been some time in a low discouraged disconsolate state of mind and we had a satisfactory time with him and he went to their meeting with us which was an open owning favored time in a distinguished manner. Evidently helped. We stayed [for] their afternoon meeting which was small and very trying to me being very feeble and over wearied but Elizabeth Kirk and Sarah Pope came in and they and Nathan all had lively service and at last I ventured and was helped beyond expectation so we left Mount Holly with good satisfaction and left Aquilla Shinn seemingly much better and came home to my house in the evening.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> A heavy thundershower at [Mount] Holly, none here.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-07-19"><dateline><date when="1812-07-19">19.</date></dateline><p> Second Day. Went to the burial of John Kaighn at Moorestown, a wealthy man. Deborah Stewart had something to say at the house and <persName key="w6b01gx6">John Cox</persName> at the grave. Pretty forcible but yet not much animation among the people. Very busy getting hay, oats etc.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-07-23"><dateline><date when="1812-07-23">23.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting very small dull low and poor. J.C. expressed his anxious concern about it. I was forced to work and weary amongst the hay.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-07-25"><dateline><date when="1812-07-25">25.</date></dateline><p> I went to mill at Haddonfield. Afternoon I went to the burial of Ruth Higby formerly our near neighbor near eighty years of age. I was over wearied though had something to say at the grave and some satisfaction: yet things low. As to the savor of life and ownings of truth, people seem to have very little thought of seeking after it or laboring for it. No wonder poverty prevails: they that will not work neither shall they eat said Paul.<note type="editorial">2 Thessalonians 3:10</note></p></div>

<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting some life stirring. <persName key="w6xt6kpr">Ann Edward</persName> appeared lively as some thought and R.C. who has been shut up in meetings above two years and myself something with them. Meeting but small.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-02"><dateline><date when="1812-08-02">2 of Eighth Month.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting but low to me.

<div type="entry" n="1812-08-06"><dateline><date when="1812-08-06">6.</date></dateline><p> Was Monthly Meeting, a pretty lively time considering and conferring on the case of spirituous liquors. Finished getting in our hay, oats and I have been favored to get through with it beyond all expectation. Our barn and hay house seldom, if ever better, filled whilst we hear of dreadful scarcity in divers places in Europe. Twenty of a day they say dropping down dead for want of bread.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-09"><dateline><date when="1812-08-09">9.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting George Gibbins a very lively hopeful young minister of Philadelphia was there and had very acceptable service. Though the waters seemed low a fine soaking shower after about four weeks' drought which seemed to threaten the cutting of the Indian corn, buckwheat and potatoes, etc.</p></div>

    <div type="entry" n="1812-08-10"><dateline><date when="1812-08-10">10th of the Eighth Month, 1812.</date></dateline><p> I went to Haddonfield Monthly Meeting. A rainy showery day both outwardly and spiritually. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> had most excellent service. A celestial shower in a lively powerful manner; he did pour it on us, but as one formerly prophesied, the time would come when there should be powerful preachers and dull hearers. So it seems to be in our days the hearts and minds of the people are like the inn of old that was filled with other guests. So it run through my mind a want of a concern, a want of right religious concern etc. Can anything be done in religion or the work of the soul's salvation without a concern? The faithful servants of the Lord never laid up treasure in heaven without experiencing a deep and weighty concern etc. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan's</persName> testimony was very lively and delivered with great force and strength. He mentioned something he had seen in his travels of the scarcity of bread; and said they that had never seen it, could hardly conceive how grievous and dreadful a calamity it was. And we have of latter time frequently heard of the great scarcity and want of bread<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin"> Where grievous wars have long prevailed</note> in divers European nations so that man drop down dead for want of bread as it is said in a day in some cities. Read the 28 chapter of Deuteronomy. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1812-08-12"><dateline><date when="1812-08-12">12.</date></dateline><p> I went to Haddonfield Mill though very poorly.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-13"><dateline><date when="1812-08-13">13.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting shut up in silence. Exceeding poor and destitute of life. I was very poorly and afflicted with a bad boil wearied over much could hardly sit.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-16"><dateline><date when="1812-08-16">16.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I find in an old bit of a newspaper this account. Curacao sunk. Captain Stevens, arrived at Boston, says it was reported at St. Domingo that the whole island of Curacao and part of Bonaire was sunk by an earthquake on the 9 of February with all the vessels in the harbor, among which was a vessel from London with a cargo worth 200,000 dollars. As one day goes another comes, and sometimes shews us dismal dooms. Yea is it not so oft times in many instances: a man with his wagon between Haddonfield and the ferry has his leg badly broke by the kick of his horse this week. It is a time of great confusion and divisions amongst the people of America: see our epistle from our last Yearly Meeting. And when you see divisions and parties and rendings in the bowels of nations and rumors and tempests in the minds of the people then take heed of being moved to this party or that party etc. Very excellent pertinent council and never perhaps more needed. One of the politicians said division is death. United we stand, divided we fall. As we read a house divided against itself cannot stand.<note type="editorial">Matthew 12:25</note></p>
<p>This party spirit between Federalists and Democrats as they are called has now got to a very great height. Some lives have been lost, divers killed in a tumult lately at Baltimore where they destroyed a printing press. And all this about the form of government. Father against son and son against father and brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor. Some who a few years ago were as intimate as brothers now so divided they can have no dealings together and this party spirit has got in amongst us and some who fill conspicuous stations. And after all there never was any law form of government or discipline ever contrived by men so calculated for the safety, peace and happiness of mankind as the Christian religion, and can anything else restore things again to the right order? <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs> and I went to Cropwell meeting and an open satisfactory time it was. Friends were very free open kind and inviting after meeting, an unmerited favor. We dined at our kinsman Joseph Rogers, heard of a dreadful accident [at] Haddonfield. Seventh Day evening a company of men met to exercise and some [indecipherable] playing with their guns loaded only with powder. One by the name of Wells [indecipherable] fired of his gun close under another's face to scare him. Another by the name of [indecipherable] was just there the [indecipherable] of the gun and it tore his brains out with the [indecipherable].</p>
<p><note type="editorial">Bottom portion of the manuscript is worn away.</note></p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin" style="text-orientation: sideways"> We hear of a woman near Germantown being suddenly killed by a horse taking fright. The wheels, for want of care, in meeting a wagon struck, frightened the horse in the chair, and he run away and threw the woman against a tree and killed her instantly. People notice these things a little but soon forget them.</note></div>

<div type="entry" n="1812-08-20"><dateline><date when="1812-08-20">20 Eighth Month, 1812.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. A very rainy morning. We have had much wet cloudy weather near two weeks past. Several not got all their oats and hay in. Since the Revolution and commencement of peace great hath been the growth of pride and high-mindedness not only in superfluity of dress but in building, furniture of houses and more especially in carriages. As it was said formerly, see Isaiah 2 chapter, their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots; and their land also is full of idols they worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made. So it is to be feared that this is really the case with the people of America in the present day in too general a way and now see what is the fruits and effects of such doings why all going into party spirits wars and confusion. As it was formerly said, they shall all go into confusion together that are makers of idols.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 45:16</note> See Jeremiah 2: 17- 19 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God when he led thee by the way? Thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in saith the Lord God of Hosts.</p>
<p>At our meeting a poor low mortifying time to me. A want of clothing about home. Very much wet weather heavy showers, a fine growing time.</p>
<p>Seventh Day Evening. I went with my old friend <persName key="w6jb6xn6">Joshua Lippincott</persName> his daughter Hannah and Deborah Steward to Nathaniel Lippincott's son of Joshua.</p></div>
    <div type="entry" n="1812-08-23"><dateline><date when="1812-08-23">23 First Day.</date></dateline><p> We had a meeting at 10 hour at Gloucester County poorhouse. Upwards of fifty there. Many poor distressed objects, some blind, some deaf, some dumb and many very lame, very ancient, feeble <del>lame</del> and very decrepit. They behaved very orderly and divers were very tender and expressed thankfulness for our visiting them, one remarkably so at parting. Though dumb or could not talk so as to be understood<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin"> He could not have showed more love at parting with his nearest relations.</note> and I believe the meeting was in some good degree favored and to general satisfaction.</p>
<p>Some of their neighbors came to it. Deborah Stewart had very acceptable service. Dined at N. Lippincott's at 3 hour this afternoon; we had a meeting at their schoolhouse and a favored, open, owning time. I believe it was to general satisfaction.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-24"><dateline><date when="1812-08-24">[24.]</date></dateline><p> Second Day. After mending two pumps for <supplied>Nathaniel. Lippincott</supplied> I got well home. It is remarkable the unusual number of accidents we hear of at this time: a pamphlet giving an account of a confession of a woman murdering her mother and was hanged for it in Sussex County, New Jersey. A woman was throwed off a chair against a tree near Germantown and killed instantly. A man dancing fell down dead instantly one Wescot towards Egg Harbor. James Hale, about seventy, cut his throat near Haddonfield. He had supported a good character an innocent, industrious man had raised up a family of children. Some of them brought trouble on him in his old age and other cross occurrences. He thus ended his days though always lived above want. A black man running a horse was throwed and broke his leg and cracked his skull so that his life is much despaired of near Moorestown.</p>
<p>Chiefly about home this week.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-27"><dateline><date when="1812-08-27">[27.]</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting, low, poor, and dull.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-08-30"><dateline><date when="1812-08-30">30.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting, a mortifying time to me. No satisfaction but very far from it.

<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting: silent, small, poor and low. No life amongst us that I could find.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1812-09-06"><dateline><date when="1812-09-06">6.</date></dateline><p> Our select meeting. A very rainy stormy morning so that I could not go to it. We hear of dreadful accounts of the wars amongst the Indians and whites. It is said the Indians have killed 300 and further dreadful accounts amongst the warlike people.
    <note type="authorial" place="left margin"> It is said the Indians have taken captive a thousand whites.</note> Heard of the death of Joshua Maule, but a middle age, a minister in great esteem. He was visiting meetings near Byberry had appointed two meetings was taken ill of a fever and died suddenly and also heard of the death of Eli Yarnall, middle aged, a great minister in good esteem. He and his son by the name of Eli both died with a short <damage><supplied>illness</supplied></damage> with what the doctors call a typhus fever.

<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> It is said the news give an account of a man murdering his wife and some others of his nearest relations in Pennsylvania.</note>

<p>Third Day. William Blakey of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting [at] Westfield and sent word to me desiring I would meet him there, which I did. I thought he did very well and that there was something quieting, calming and savory but alas, meetings are become cheap and line upon line, precept upon precept and plenty makes dainty. And life and power much wanting. In the beginning the powerful overshadowings of the Holy Ghost was frequently felt amongst friends at meeting.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Dined with my dear friend William Blakey at J. Lippincott. He went then to Vincentown.</note>
<p>Fifth Day. At our Monthly Meeting although something lively and pretty well yet it was not altogether satisfactory to me. More of that humility and fear which keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life that preserves from the snare of death, upon retrospection, I thought was wanting. Charity suffers long and is kind,<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 13:4</note> something of it wanting in my zeal against a selfish, covetous hard dealing spirit that loves to buy cheap and sell dear. When thou buyest ought of thy neighbor or sellest ought to thy neighbor ye shall not oppress one another. Again thou hast dealt by oppression; thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbor by extortion. Can thine heart endure or thine hands be strong in the day that I shall deal with thee?<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 22:14</note> A spirit very prevalent in this our day: although extortion in Scripture is ranked amongst the blackest of crimes yet it is become so common that it is hardly thought to be any harm or crime at all, and even amongst us a people professing to great refinement but it is so contrary to love and unity that can an extortioner lay any claim to charity without which as the apostle says, all is nothing without a spirit I have ever abhorred. And my zeal against it sometimes too warm, but such is the power of custom that from Scripture accounts. Amongst the Sodomites and in the days of Phinehas, and Babel Pear and some ages and nations since, whoredom was so customary a thing amongst them that it was thought little or no crime at all – such is the power of custom.</p>

Thomas reminded them of the striping times about thirty years ago when some had scarcely a cow or hoof left on their farm, and Richard appeared in prayer at last in a powerful manner.

[She] was buried yesterday at Evesham. And also heard of the death of Samuel Cooper about seventy or a little younger than myself. An old schoolmate, he owned the ferry and although he had great possessions, was vastly rich, he retired from business, obtained a right amongst Friends became a much improved man and was very helpful, open-hearted and kind in entertaining friends and their horses and its likely will be very much missed: repeated calls to old and young. Anne Mifflin came to see me and shewed me a letter she received from her son who is traveling in the back countries, Ohio etc., informs that there was there very great alarms for fear of the Indians that he saw families fleeing from their habitations in almost every direction. Children that was big enough to travel has a bundle to carry, and that some they met would flee into the woods and hide and could hardly be persuaded that their fears were groundless and the alarms false, although it appeared it really was so.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> This alarm Thomas Frinch living at Ohio told me was caused by a great number of soldiers who had been defeated and then passed homeward through their country from Detroit where the battle was and a great number taken prisoners.</note>
<p>But the case was doleful however false the alarms might be. There was such false alarms here in the time of the wars: many fled and hid and great to do there was hiding provisions, cloths and goods, etc. But indeed life and property did seem often to be in a very uncertain precarious situation at that time. It was said that time 1774 many of our young men had fled to Cedar swamps etc. to hide themselves and some have fled now, see Jeremiah 4:29 verse: the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and shall climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein, and see Ezekiel 13:12 and Hosea 10:13.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1813-02-10"><dateline><date when="1813-02-10">10 of the Second Month, 1813.</date></dateline><p> Some observations on the happiness of an humble and serious life compared with that spent in vain passion pleasures and to eagerly pursuing the riches and honors of this world.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> great snow.</note>
<p>In order to check the inordinate desires after riches which some of the professors of Christianity formerly manifested and is equally applicable in this day, Saint Clemens, one of the primitive Christians who was wholly devoted to serve his Lord and master and an eminent instrument in the hand of God in gathering many into the fold of rest expresses himself on this wise: He that troubles not himself with anxious thoughts for more than is necessary lives little less than the life of angels whilst by a mind content with little he imitates their want of nothing. But those whose minds are taken up with an anxious thoughts for the things of this world only have been compared to Nebuchadnezzar at grass when a beast's heart was given him.<note type="editorial">Daniel 4</note> See Ecclesiastes 3:18: I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts; see next verse 18.</p>
<p>Wycliffe thought all arts which administered to the luxuries of life were prohibited by the Gospel, and is it not so in these words be ye not conformed to this world?<note type="editorial">Romans 12:2</note> Was this strictly observed? Oh, what stripping work it would make now in our day wherein there is so much conformity to the ways customs maxims and manners of this world. Further, Wycliffe says the Scripture tells us that having food and raiment we should therewith be content.<note type="editorial">Timothy 6:8</note> Reinhar though a Papish writer, gives a very favorable account of Wycliffe's followers and disciples. He says they were men of a serious modest deportment avoiding all ostentation in dress, chaste and temperate, never seen in taverns or amused by the trifling gaieties of life – that they utterly despised wealth being fully content with bare necessaries: see [William] Gilpin's Life of Wycliffe.</p>
<p>Hence it appears that these first reformers as well as the primitive Christians took our Savior's injunction in Matthew 6:19, Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth in a more literal sense than it has been understood by many high professors in more latter days. They were sensible of this declaration Mark 10:23, that it would be hard for those that had accumulated wealth or riches had added house to house and field to field.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 5:8</note> to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. The pious <persName key="w6cv5qpd">William Law</persName> on the spirit of prayer page 105 expresses himself thus; the heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind. See <title>Book of Martyrs</title>. How many righteous, faithful Protestants were burnt for heretics, and, oh, how doth a worldly spirit prevail although it is so much testified and cautioned against in Scripture? Be ye not conformed to this world<note type="editorial">Romans 12:2</note> Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth.<note type="editorial">Matthew 6:19</note>: Oh earth, earth. earth, hear Oh earth<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 22:29</note> Go to ye rich man weep and howl for the miseries that shall come upon you.<note type="editorial">James 5:1</note> How hath it drowned many in destruction and perdition.<note type="editorial">Timothy 6:9</note> How stupefied and besotted many are as to religion become like the heath in the desert.<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 17:6</note> or deaf adder.<note type="editorial">Psalms 58:4</note> And further says <persName key="w6cv5qpd">William Law</persName> we are apt to consider the temper as only an infirmity and pardonable failure but it is indeed the great apostasy from God and the Divine life. And Thomas à Kempis makes this just remark vanity most certainly it is with great solicitude to seek and place our hope and confidence in riches. Vanity – to cherish our ambition and strive by all possible means to attain a high and honorable station. Vanity most exquisite to be infinitely concerned for living long and perfectly indifferent or but coldly affected about living well.</p>

<p>And such is the vanity of coveting great possessions that the learned, wise, and rich of this world, when alarmed with the solemn prospect of death and verging on the brink of an awful eternity, have to acknowledge unto the insufficiency thereof. Great numbers of instances of the truth of this might be collected; and some have even of the great and learned had to lament and confess and say, Ah! I have consumed a great part of my life in laborious doing nothing; and is it not to be feared that great numbers will see at last that they have consumed their time in things that do not profit, in laborious doing nothing: Straight is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life and few there be that find it.<note type="editorial">Matthew 7:14</note> Is it not strange to think and see how trifling, lukewarm and indifferent the generality of people spend their time and how inconsistent and contradictory it is to the profession and life of a Christian, which is a life of diligence, worthy moral precept.</p>

Heard of the death of Joseph Wilcox of Upper Evesham, upwards of eighty years, an innocent man and several others young people. One, tis said, a woman, died drunk. A.D. at Haddonfield and Rebeckah Coal, a young woman died of the consumption at Moorestown. Yet we hear of many deaths round about. A mortal fever prevails in divers places. Many accounts we hear of this mortal fever prevailing in New England, divers years past and of latter time in divers places round about us as <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> said when in his public testimony related how this fever raged in New England that it had seemed to him that other parts of our continent would be visited in like manner. William Branin of Evesham with his wife and son, a young man, were buried a few days ago with a mortal fever.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1813-02-21"><dateline><date when="1813-02-21">21.</date></dateline><p> First Day. A very cold storm of snowy time but moderates and I got to our meeting and came off middling well I hope though lowness and indolence too generally prevails – remark worthy of attention.</p>
<p>To think to spend his life in the advancement of science, the improvements of mankind, and the communication of happiness, whose time is employed in the unceasing use of his faculties and the energy of virtue, is the boast of the world, the delight of the Almighty, and the perfection of human nature.</p>
<p>Second Day. Very stormy. Snow, hail and rain and cold.
<pb n="012" facs="334972"/>
A remark worthy of attention. Amidst all the vices and all the enormities of the Algerine Turks (a people distinguished for violence and rapacity and almost every species of cruelty) some good qualities are observable. The most abandoned wretch never presumes to utter the name of God in vain, or add it by way of decoration to his ribaldry. When will this be said even of men who boast and glory in their superior light and information?</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1813-02-26"><dateline><date when="1813-02-26">26 Second Month, 1813.</date></dateline><p> Weather more moderate. I got out to our select meeting at Moorestown and an owning, favored time it was notwithstanding the frailties and weaknesses that abound. Oh, how we are followed and spared when many are sorely afflicted with sore sickness and afflicted many ways and many deaths we almost daily hear of. Elizabeth Lippincott upwards of eighty years and several others much younger buried last Fifth Day. </p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1813-02-27"><dateline><date when="1813-02-27">27.</date></dateline><p> Grows very cold again and we hear of dreadful slaughters amongst the Indians and white people.

<div type="entry" n="1813-02-27"><dateline><date when="1813-02-27">27.</date></dateline><p> We have had a long spell of hard winter weather. Ground covered with snow many weeks but now winter seems to break up, and something like spring weather snow goes off.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1813-02-28"><dateline><date when="1813-02-28">28.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I was at Cropwell Meeting and an open, owning, strengthening, healing time. It was to general satisfaction I believe. Friends after meeting were very pleasant kind and inviting unusually so. Oh, what a favor! Yet continued notwithstanding the much there is wanting on our part and the many frailties and weaknesses amongst us. We hear of much sickness round about and several sudden deaths about Haddonfield. Richard Matlack a youngish man, though married, and John Clements's wife left a family of children and one very young. Buried today or yesterday.</p>
<p>See the 9 Chapter of Nehemiah, the latter part of it of God's goodness and mercy in sparing and forgiving a backsliding rebellious people whom the Lord had done much for as is there set forth and much hath been done for us.</p>
<p>I think I see there is a growth in divers young ministers in divers places, notwithstanding the indifferency and lukewarmness that too generally prevails, and in divers places very amiable, clear, bright, able ministers of latter years are come forth.</p>
<p>Although we have had a long spell of cold freezing snowy weather first of the Third Month there was a heavy thundershower before the snow was quite gone. It is said the thunder struck down a chimney in Moorestown and stunned a child or girl, which recovered. This thunder coming so early and heavy seemed to be somewhat alarming to some with other thing: the wars and sickness round about in many places especially eastward in East Jersey. It is said eight graves were opened in one day in one yard and that two joiners one had made eighty and the other forty coffins and then died themselves.</p></div>

There was a great number of spectators, many young men and young women very gay in their dress and appearance but behaved pretty orderly and well, and the school appeared to be preserved orderly though I thought there was much that opposed the right way of truth. Yet at last it manifestly raised into dominion over all and I had an owning satisfactory time. One said he was glad I was there.</p></div>

Samuel Leeds of Egg Harbor spoke first and did very well. Mentioned the sickness which prevailed there. Very mortal. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> was raised in great eminence in the exercise of his most famous gift. He also mentioned the great sickness in New England where he had a few years ago lived, which took off many to the unknown regions of eternity, as he expressed it. He said it would come and break out in places, towns and villages, rage awhile and then go of without any remedies being found to stop it and that there was no fleeing from it, for it seemed to follow them from place to place where ever they went and said the physicians called it a malignant typhus fever and there are many round about us here who have been suddenly taken away with and divers now ill with it. Several very sudden deaths. We hear of one woman at Gloucester (Matlack) had five children was making up her bread and then went to take up her child to suckle it and fell on her face and died immediately. Oh what alarming calls frequently repeated and yet how trifling indifferency prevails respecting that of being in readiness at a short warning.</p>
<p>Third Month, 14, First Day. At our meeting came off middling well satisfied. Our son <persName key="w6vz1749">Joseph</persName> from Pennsylvania was here to see us with three of their children, fine and healthy. About home nothing material, unless it is the almost daily accounts of sickness and very sudden deaths. Three burials at Haddonfield in one day and accounts of the sickness prevailing and many deaths in places accounted formerly the most healthy in the Barrens.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Heard of eight burials at a time in one yard. Robert Rowand buried at Haddonfield a hard drinker.</note>
<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting Levi Lippincott and Hannah Roberts were married. It was a low dull time forepart but growed better and ended pretty well. J. Matlack and <persName key="w6xt6kpr">Ann Edwards</persName> both appeared just at last. Heard of several sudden deaths. One woman, Abraham Matlack's daughter, and he buried a few weeks ago, it was thought [she] took too much anodyne and slept to death. Left a family.

<note type="authorial" place="margin"> McBride and King, the men's names.</note>
<p>The fathers and mothers both died with this prevailing disorder called the typhus or nervous fever and left nineteen children in the two families.

They are young ministers, weakly and tender in body but bold and strong in spirit.

Phineas Lord of Woodbury, an elder was one; he was here to see me in my sickness about two years ago with Joseph Whiteall and John Wilkins of Upper Evesham as it is said went to see his son-in-law's family Hugh Sharp, who lately died with the disorder J. Wilkins took sick there and there died below Haddonfield. We have had a long spell of wet cloudy stormy weather, which much affects my asthmatic cough, but yet have got out to meeting – though often so poorly I can hardly keep up.</p>

Although I was very poorly with the asthma and colic I went to the burial of <persName key="w6fs0n6b">Job Cowperthwaite</persName>, who died very suddenly. A very hard drinker, a worthless, base man many ways. I have dealt very closely and plainly with him, and he has always seemed to respect me and has been very kind to me. The people behaved orderly, still and quiet, but there seemed no more concern than if it had been the burial of a horse. There seemed no openness for to say any thing scarcely, yet I had some little remarks and felt no condemnation nor much satisfaction. He has left six sons and six daughters and they have buried several very young. George Graham went to Trenton on business, was throwed out of his carriage and found dead. He also was said to be a drunken man, but these solemn awful calls seem to have little or no effect on the drunkards. They buried him there and then dug him up and brought him home.</p></div>

See <persName key="w6q061bh">Stephen Crisp's</persName> <title>Sermons, </title>page 231, the word of God a Christian's Life: I exhort you all in the love of God that you would prize this manner of speaking and look upon it as the greatest mercy that ever you enjoyed – prize it above all your mercies. Health and wealth and all other mercies are not worthy to be compared to this voice of God speaking in you. They that prize it will never complain for want of power; they will find power in it. All the power in Heaven and earth is contained in this truth that shines unto you etc. Page 232: amongst all the blessing with which we are favored yet this is a blessing which can only make the soul happy, that an intercourse between it and its maker is open: and can we not easily see the state of poor man without it? Do we not fall below the brutal part of the creation? This is evident in thousands of instances without it. I heard one say they never heard of such numbers of sudden deaths as now of late, both in town and country. In town a widow Rogers died instantly at breakfast. Samuel Webster, an elder of Haddonfield, went to Salem, was taken with this prevailing disorder and brought home a corpse (we hear). Both far advanced in year between seventy and eighty. </p></div>

There were several neighbors, relations and we had a satisfactory little sitting together, however I believe it was so to all of us. This was the last time I seen him. See Thomas à Kempis, page 147, on resignation, etc. It is hard to judge rightly whether a good spirit or the contrary incline thee to desire this or that or whether thou art not moved by thine own spirit. Many are deceived in the end who at the first seemed to be led by a good spirit.</p>

<p>We hear of an alarming accident a few days ago. Lawyer Morgan of Philadelphia was going up the river to his farm and had his boat loaded too heavy, tis said, with marble. Had his house keeper, Lidia Johnson, an aged woman, and a young woman, a Philadelphia man and a Negro man. A gale of wind came up and the boat, being too heavy loaded, filled and sunk. The two women and Negro man were drowned. Morgan and the other buoyed themselves up with the oars till assistance came to them. See the uncertainty of time and the truth of Seneca's remarks: when we go out we don't know we shall return, etc. I hear of dismal scenes of sorrow all round us. Ann Matlack, wife of <persName key="w6t25v7b">Joseph</persName>, lays, ill with a dismal cancer which they say smells very nauseous or very bad, and John Brick lost his reason, which some say is the greatest calamity of human beings.

<div type="entry" n="1813-06-20"><dateline><date when="1813-06-20">20.</date></dateline><p> First Day. A very rainy morning. I have worked and wearied myself more than I was able. See 1 Kings 19:11 verse: and a strong wind rent the mountain. Psalms 7:2: lest he tear my soul and rent it in pieces. Psalms 50:22: consider this lest I tear you in pieces. Two evenings last week there was very hard winds, heavy thundershowers which tore down many of our fruit trees and beat down the rye some. At Mount Holly I am told there was hailstones as big as the end of a man's thumb but did not do much damage. Went to our meeting and I thought somewhat favored, but I was wearied over much and on the whole had no satisfaction. But otherwise not able to travel I hear that the hard winds has blowed down the rye so that some say in places they will never be able to gather one half of it, and abundance of timber blowed down. See <title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title>, page 130, <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> and others visit to that nation: oh the brokenness that was among them in the flowings of life! So that in the power and Spirit of the Lord, many together broke out into singing with audible voice. Then an account follows of a dreadful war broke out and a time of dreadful suffering and great distress and destruction, yet Friends were generally preserved through all, and see page 165: and besides all this at the return of the armies to winter quarters the country was filled with violent sickness, which took away many of all sorts. Some seemed to grieve at their losses and low estate and so languished and died, which friends were greatly supported over having an eye to the Lord who not only gives but takes or suffers to be taken away. Then see page 177: Now after the troubles and scarcity above mentioned there suddenly succeeded a time of great plenty after a wonderful manner beyond what could be expected, and the time of getting great riches came on as the time of great losses had been experienced before, and many too eagerly pursued them, which proved very injurious to them and their children. Beware, said the prophet, least your hearts deceive you and you and ye be drawn aside after other gods.<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 11:16</note> See it is said some stood firm in all the troubles and trials and fell in this time of prosperity. Their persecutors could not frighten them from keeping up their meetings with all their swords and guns and bitter abuses, yet see what follows. See page 284: It is observable that in this time of outward peace and freedom from sufferings of divers kinds to which friends had been exposed, cause was given for complaints to their superior meetings 1720 of the breach of minutes through the prevalence of a loose libertine spirit among many of our youth and a careless, sleepy, slothful spirit with respect to religious duties among some more aged. And see page 404: not all the persecutions, said a certain eminent elder, not all the apostates nor all the open or private enemies we have ever had have done us as a Christian society the damage that riches have done. Then follow an account how grievously these times of prosperity spoiled their youth, etc., and many grievous evils it introduced, the way opening to get riches, etc.</p>

<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting very small and low and poor, yet I believe there was an earnest concern, and some stirrings of life appeared at last amongst a remnant, on account of the dullness and many deficiencies, after so much labor bestowed on us as we have had of late. Remember the ground that being after water and brings forth briars, etc.</p>
<p><title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title> and see the conclusion, page 470: behold a people raised up under very great sufferings through persecution, wars, scarcity sometimes of bread and thriving under opposition and great oppression and what great numbers of powerful ministers, men and women and some even boys and girls were raised up in their youthful days who were made instrumental to batten down the strongholds of sin and Satan. Behold also a pattern of the restoration of Christian discipline to its primitive simplicity and purity. And after all, at last the pernicious effects of ease and affluence with respect to the prosperity of the church may be here clearly perceived – and that at length to be brought about in the days of outward liberty and ease, which all the storms of persecution were not able to effect, as in the forgoing part of the history appears, viz. coolness of love to God and one another. And too too many of the descendants of those men, who maintained their integrity unviolated in times of suffering, now loosing the primitive simplicity and moderation and in imminent danger of being incorporated again with the world and its corruptions, as by the latter part of this history appears. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1813-06-01813"><dateline><date when="1813-06-27">1813 First Day, 27 Sixth Month.</date></dateline><p> See page 9, <title>Rise and Progress</title>: the true origin of this woeful apostasy seems to have been pretty deeply seated viz. in the corruption of human nature. We are told that pride found admittance even among the angels and degraded them from their heavenly stations. It also, through the inspiration of the serpent, found entrance into paradise and appears to have been one principal cause of the fall of our first parent, see Genesis 3: 5-6, etc.</p>
<p>And again upon the same principle, what else but pride was the origin of those great contentions we read of that the Christians of the fourth century fell into about their creeds, etc.? 10 page: Outward ease, liberty, and an affluence of the riches of this world. When the churches fortune grew better, her sons grew worse and some of her fathers worst of all. The corruption of Christians dated from the time they became rich, endowed with lands, pensions and patrimonies etc. Their bishops, feeling the smack of wealth, ease and prosperity, began to swell in pride and pomp, etc. Where I also read that about this time, a voice was heard, as it were, from heaven over the city of Constantinople, saying this day is poison poured forth into the churches. So a dismal account follows of grievous suffering to the faithful by persecution, wars and scarcity of bread and grievous sickness were the people afflicted with.</p>
<p><persName key="w65q5g7f">Samuel Fothergill</persName> in one [of] his sermons says pride has been the downfall of the greatest empires and flourishing countries that ever was in the world. I have read the <title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title> through in less than a week, near 500 pages. A great favorite of mine, have not seen it several years. I take it up when I am weary and cannot work any longer, which often happens now a days.

It is now a time of great trial upon you in loosing what you have. But the time will come when you will be as greatly tried with getting wealth, which was soon after accomplished. It somewhere said in that book [added later: I found now page 476], the words of an eminent minister: that corruption never did overspread the church but when or unless the ministers and elders gave way. These are looked upon as the principal pillars.</p></div>

Two things have I required of thee.

<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting, which was very small and to me very poor and low. I feel the effects of old age and am forced to weary myself too much. Help very scarce and dear.

And although I had no satisfaction, I felt no condemnation or a wish to recall what I had to say amongst the people. Yet something was wanting in me or them or both. Between me and him there has been an uninterrupted unity between thirty and forty years. He was an elder of good and sound judgment although of but few words; he was like a father to me, and we were always suited together with one another's company. I was with him in a spell of illness above thirty years ago when he expressed a willingness to die. I told him it was a fine thing to be willing to die. He said yes and to know for what, too, and he has in several spells of sickness since expressed the same resignation, so he is now gone and gathered like a shock of corn in its season, I have no doubt, gathered into the corner of rest and peace.

So I went to our meeting, concluding to quite lay by or shut up. But soon after I sat down, found I was favored, and a satisfactory, open, owning, strengthening time it was. Oh, how little do we know where it is best for us to be! Surely mercy and goodness follows us about hay, etc. Nothing very material to remark except as I remark a few weeks ago we frequently hear of scenes of sorrow and that John Brick had lost his reason, and now we hear he is dead, cut his own throat. See John Everard's <title>Works</title>, page 75: if thou hast set thy seal to the creatures and that they have stolen away thy heart and thou art in love with them, knit to them and art made one with them, then when thou comest die thou hast no refuge to trust to; they will all fail thee, etc. An excellent sentence and see page 132, respecting a right use of the creatures and not abusing them or our selves with them in pride and wantonness, etc. Page 158 he says, I remember also, a speech of Bernard's that mind is far from God or heaven which in prayers (or desires) is full of earthly requests. But, oh, is not the universal language give, give? Give us prosperous, plentiful seasons so that our barns etc. may be well filled. Then what next? Eat, drink and take thy rest. Like him we read of whose ground brought forth plentifully etc., but what follows, thou fool? This night shall thy soul be required of thee, and then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?<note type="editorial">Luke 12:16-20</note> So it shall be with all those that lay up treasures for themselves and are not rich towards God.</p>
<p>This is harvest time, and, on the whole, some say a rich plentiful harvest, although in places much beat down with the hard winds and, tis said, hurt in places with the hail, which it is said that the hail stones was as big as a man's watch a few miles eastward of us.</p></div>

Some years ago the grain was shrunk and little and black. It seemed as if there was but very little meal in it. What lessons of instruction: by these things we may see how easy a great deal may soon be blasted and a little blessed.</p>

I could not see that anyone was burdened, but it ended well. Very different from last First Day, when all was shut up, naked, poor and empty. Ambrose Chapman, an intelligent young man who has kept school amongst us, lately returned from a tour in the western territories, state of Ohio, etc. Informs me that it is very trying times with friends there; they being drafted and fined and distressed with the military men of martial spirits and that they are very bitter and malicious against Friends for refusing to assist in the wars and many families women and children in great fears of the Indians and sometimes frightened and alarmed with false alarms in the night, so that many are very much afraid to stay at their home and want to move. Yet he says their country as to improvements is vastly improved and prosperous; their land being very fertile, they abound in vast, great plenty. It seems incredible to tell what vast improvements have been made. In about twenty year ago, I was first there. They had no Monthly Meeting over the mountains; their young people were then forced to come over to Fairfax Monthly Meeting to pass meeting, and now in that space of time they, I think they say, have five quarterly meetings, and now this fall they are to have a yearly meeting to be held at Short Creek. Seldom if ever was there ever know a more rapid settlement. Far and wide for many hundreds of miles and a vast number of Friends there settled and many great towns and vast numbers of villages, where but a few years ago was inhabited by the Indians or an entire vast, howling wilderness inhabited only by wolves, bears and beast and birds of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Was at our meeting which was not the lowest and poorest to me, though silent. As to me, see <title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title>, page 77, the words of John Webster preached in 1654, viz: It is not holding forth the highest profession of Christ in the letter that makes us free, except Christ come into the heart and make us free, indeed. The chief thing every soul is to mind, in reading and hearing, is to examine whether the same thing be wrought in them – whatever we find in the letter, if it be not made good in us, what are the words to us? We must see how Christ is crucified and buried in us and how he is risen and raised from death in us. The chief thing, I say, is to look into our own breasts. All generally that hold forth a profession of Christ, they say in words that Christ is the Deliverer. But that is not the thing – is he a Deliverer to thee? Is that glorious Messiah promised and the Deliverer with power come into thy soul? Hath he exalted himself there? Hath he made bare his arm and been a glorious conqueror in thee? Hath he taken to himself his great power to reign in thee? Is he, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, in thee? What ever thou talkest of Christ and his miracles, if thou hast no witness, no evidence, of the truth of them in thy own heart, what is all that ever he did, and what is all that ever he suffered to thee? It may be thou hast or mayst have a notion and opinion of the things of God and thou hast them by history and by relation or education or example or customs or by tradition or because most men have received them for truths. But if thou hast not evidence of his mighty miracles and god like power in thy own soul, how canst thou be a witness that they are the things that thou hast seen and heard? For all those outward things are but shadows and representations, figures and patterns of the Heavenly things themselves. Thou mayst have a strong opinion but no experience of them, viz. that Christ hath freed and delivered thy soul. Hast thou really seen thyself in captivity deaf, dumb, blind, and lame? Oh, that men were but come to this condition, to be sensible of their misery! Oh then what mourning, what hanging of their harps upon the willows and sitting by the rivers of Babylon and crying out, How shall we sing the Lords song in a strange land? Till they have deliverance they cannot but mourn and who can deliver them but the Lion of the Tribe of Judah? To such a soul only Christ is precious. Others may talk of him and make a great profession of him, but they cannot Love him til he be Immanuel and Saviour in them. Forms and ordinances cannot be the rest of a Christian, because they may be used and lived in and admired and prized whilst those that use them may be carried away with divers lusts. Thus, may not one be dipped. and receive water baptism and yet be a sorcerer? Was not Simon Magus so? May not one be at breaking of bread with Christ and yet be a devil? Yes, for so was Judas, so for Webster.</p>

Yet at last not that satisfactory as at some times. See 2 of Samuel 19 and 11 verse: why are ye the last to bring the king back? This seemed to illustrate in my view and an instructing lesson. Verse the 9: they were remind what the king had done for them, how he had saved them out of the hand of their enemies and delivered them out of the hand of the Philistines, etc. Now the King of Kings seeks a place and dwelling amongst us, stands knocking at the door of our hearts and hath promised to be with the two or three gathered in his name [Matthew 18:20], but, oh, the backwardness to bring him in, although it would be our greatest interest at all times and all occasion to be above all things carefully concerned to bring back the King. But oh the indifferency, the unconcernedness!

Thy mind must be set on heavenly things and thy conversation on heaven, and see <title>Power of Religion on the Mind</title> by <persName key="w66696rh">Lindley Murray</persName>, page 123, the words of John Janeway: He was full of love and compassion to the souls of men and often greatly lamented the barrenness of Christians with their converse with each other. Oh, said he, what indifference to spend an hour or two together and to hear scarce a word that speaks peoples' hearts in love with holiness! Where is our love to God and our fellow creatures all this while? Where is our sense of the preciousness of time? Of the greatness of our accounts should we talk thus if we believed we should hear of it again at the Day of Judgment? Does not this speak aloud that our hearts are devoid of grace and that we have little sense of spiritual and eternal concerns?

<p>1813. See the same book page 42 P.B.'s words: may I be enabled to evince by words and actions that in conversation the Lord is to be praised and honored in stillness. Page 39 and 40 is a very remarkable account of his being at a meeting where a minister, Thomas Cox of Erith, rose up and, having appeared in public testimony about half an hour, sat down. About a minute after which, he was seized with an apoplectic fit, and expired immediately. I have been informed that John Estaugh, a worthy minister, was seized with an apoplectic fit as he was standing preaching at Haddonfield but recovered. And see the account of Robert Jordan of Philadelphia. At the house of his friend waiting for the hour of meeting, he was seized with a fit of the apoplexy and died about midnight following. See Memorials page 118: a great and laborious minister in the 49 years of his age, a minister 24 years, and see the account of Peter Fearson of Burlington, page 220: he was seized with a fit by his own fireside, which quickly deprived him of his understanding, and about 3 days after he died. He had traveled very extensively in many countries. And my near and dear old friend <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName>, it was thought, died in a fit very suddenly after he had finished several extensive journeys. <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> was suddenly removed just after he had been highly favored at a meeting and <persName key="w67h3crq">Joseph White</persName> and divers others, as I have remarked, after favored open opportunities suddenly taken away by death.

Then we went to see Edmund Darling and wife. A difference had happened between him and his brother-in-law Joseph Thorn, which had been carried to monthly and quarterly meeting. After an opportunity with them, went in to see his ancient mother, upwards of four-score. Then we had a sitting with a company of young people, one of the daughter a cripple (by sickness), then went to see Joseph Thorn, and in every opportunity I think there appeared tenderness and tears, so all seemed right and to end well. Yet I wanted to feel more of the savor of life and ownings of truth.</p>
<p>Second Day hauling out dung but I am not strong enough to do but little. See the writings of that eminent servant of the Lord, Humphrey Smith, page 330. Speaking of the fall of the unfaithful, says: and they that seek themselves shall have self enough, but self shall never help them in that day. Neither shall their own wisdom stand them instead... We read in Scripture of men that were lovers of themselves.<note type="editorial">2 Timothy 3:2</note> A selfish spirit is a dismal thing, vastly different from the philanthropist, a universal lover of mankind. The very Indians abhor a selfish spirit. Carver, who traveled many thousands of miles amongst the Indians, says (as <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> remarks), that there is no greater stigma (or reflection or disgrace) amongst the Indians than to say he loves himself or that any one is selfish. I believe they seen what the effects would be if a selfish spirit was suffered to have a growth: and is it not to be feared there is too much of it amongst us? Lovers of themselves, lovers of money, lovers of this world, etc., etc., more than lovers of God. Israel is an empty vine.

<p>1813. Page 82: He remarks the many memorable instances in <title>Piety Promoted </title>of children from nine years old to fifteen and twenty appearing in public testimony in meetings, and further said: the great preference due to religion before earthly substance in the education of children but I have often long ago observed how earthly substance is preferred in their education, even as if it was chiefly to be minded, and where and when it is so. Is it any wonder religion is at a low ebb?</p>
<p>How foolish and unwise are men who are bartering their souls for gold, paltry gold. The too eager pursuit of it is a great hurt to some of our society, etc.</p>
<p>Page 84: our religion teaches us to believe in immediate communion with God through his beloved son, which is an unspeakable privilege to all who attend to it. 88: speaking of the wickedness in the world, he added, I would not be understood to despise the world itself. No, it is the creation of God and we are placed there to enjoy all things with temperance. If it were as it ought to be, it would be a sort of Paradise; it would be a happy pilgrimage to eternity. It is the depravity of man that makes it so detestable. In another place he says, I believe great advantage may arise from frequently comparing time with eternity, an awful eternity. Again, what would I give now for all the world? Why, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Then let us begin to prepare and do everything that is required of us. I believe plainness of dress is required of us, plainness of dress is as a hedge about us; the world is not then seeking our company.

Oh how much of it there is in these days, and if a conformity to the world is a breach of this command and a denial of Christ before men, oh, much of it is the now in our days. I remember a remark of my dear son, Samuel Hunt, who died about the 25 year of his age. When he was a lad, he said he thought he could see but very few but what was more or less swayed by custom, or conformed more or less to the customs of the world etc.</p>
<p>Fifth Day 9 of Ninth Month. See Thomas à Kempis, page 186: All who are lovers of themselves are fettered in bondage, full of desires, curious wanderers seeking self Indulgence and not the things of Jesus Christ but often devising and framing.

Ninth Month 1813.</date></dateline><p> See <title>No Cross No Crown</title>, page 345, words of Anthony Lowther, frequently professing he knew no joy comparable to that of being assured of the love and mercy of God, etc. For that he did not only think virtue the safest but the happiest way of living, commending and commanding it to his children upon his last blessing.</p>
<p>And see page 375, <title>No Cross No Crown</title>; how memorable was that of origin: if my father were weeping upon his knees before me and my mother hanging about my neck behind me and all my brethren, sisters, and kinsfolks lamenting on every side to retain me in the life and practice of the world, I would fling my mother to the ground, run over my father, despise all my kindred and tread them under my feet that I might run to Christ. Yet it is not unknown how dutiful and tender he was in these relations. But, oh, to consider how indifferent, how trifling, how unconcerned the generality of the people are and, instead of being so earnest to run to Christ, run from him after trifles, so, like Esau, sell their birthright for a mess of pottage [Genesis 25:23-34]. Many sacrificing wife and children, houses and land, trample all under foot to run after strong drink and other sensual pleasures and worldly gratifications. Nay, thousands sacrificing their own very lives in the pursuit of sensual delights and the pleasures, honors, and profits of this transitory world. See the sufferings of the martyrs, etc.</p>
<p>See page 38, speaking of Abraham's obedience in offering up his son Isaac, he says: so that it is not the sacrifice that recommends the heart but the heart that gives the sacrifice acceptance. The bent intent and principle desire of the heart is the principle thing. Where the treasure is there, will the heart be also.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> The heresy of all heresies is a worldly mind says <persName key="w6cv5qpd">William Law</persName>. Oh, Earth, Earth, hear, oh.</note>
<p>And see page 36 and 10:</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Woe to them that have their hearts in earthly possessions for when they are gone, their heaven is gone with them. It is too much the sin of the best part of the world that they stick in the comforts of it. And it is lamentable to behold how their affections are bemired and entangled with their conveniences and accommodations in it. The true self-denying man is a pilgrim, but the selfish man is an inhabitant of the world. The one uses it as men do ships to transport themselves or tackle in a journey, that is to get home; the other looks no farther, whatever he prates, than to be fixed in fullness and ease here and likes it so well that if he could he would not exchange. However, he will not trouble himself to think of the other world till he is sure he must live no longer in this, but then, alas, it will prove too late; not to Abraham but to dives he must go. The story is as true as sad says <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> [<title>No Cross, No Crown</title>]. Some had bought land, some had married wives and others had bought yokes of oxen and could not come, Luke 14, 18: 19, 20. Is it not so now in our days? See page 15: go to the gods whom you have served, your beloved lusts which you have worshiped and the evil world you have so much coveted and adored. Let them save you now if they can from the wrath to come upon you, which is the ages of the deeds you have done. Here is the end of their work that build upon the sand, etc.</note>

<p>Sixth Day 1 of the Tenth Month. I went to Cropwell meeting which was small and the waters low yet some stirrings of life and pretty open, but I had not much satisfaction nor felt condemnation. It is a time of much prosperity people and bemired in the concerns of this world.</p>

<p>Second Day. Very stormy. See <title>Piety Promoted</title>, a new piece lately published by J. G. Bevans, page 55, an account of the sudden death of Margaret Granwood: the day was agreed on which she and one of her sisters was to be married. Each suitor had the name of John. One morning early, their father said to the two sisters pleasantly that he supposed they would not give up their Johns for any consideration whatever. Margaret replied after a pause that there was one thing and but one for which she could or would give up her John: a place in the Kingdom of Heaven. She appeared at that time to be free from indisposition, but about ten in the forenoon, as she sat employed in her knitting, she breathed her last. The preceding day she had attended the general meeting at Dent Town and had born a lively and weighty testimony  I heard the other day of the death of Moses Ashead, a young man was buried the day that was appointed for him to be married, and also heard of the death of two young men in Evesham out of one house by the name of Winer, and of the death of <persName key="w6028wf4">Nicholas Waln</persName> of Philadelphia, a great minister, and of Joseph Glovyer, in the bloom of life left a family of young children, and of divers others round about, with a kind of flux and fevers.

In his 84 year, and seems as bright and clear in his faculties, except hardness of hearing, as ever. Called to see my old neighbor Jonathan Morgan, in a very poorly, weakly state 76th year.

They were long a gathering. The waters seemed low, a great want of lively zeal, but after a while the house was fully crowded. Nemiah Sleeper was there from Mt. Holley and had savory service, and, although I felt forepart very poor and discouraged, I had an open time to satisfaction, and it seemed to end well. People were very kind and inviting after meeting. Got home this evening and felt no cause to repent going, no condemnation. About home. Cold, freezing, clear, dry weather.</p></div>

They say a general complaint round about. See <persName key="w63j7f09">Peter Charron</persName> <title>Of Wisdom</title>, first volume, page 64, concerning the soul in general: there is not in the world any one opinion which hath been more universally entertained, more eagerly embraced, more plausibly defended, more religiously stuck to (I may well say religiously, since this doctrine is, in truth, the very foundation of all true religion) than [illegible] that which asserts the immortality of the soul. All this is meant of an external and public profession for, alas, it is but too manifest and too melancholy a truth. And the prodigious numbers of epicures and profane libertines, scoffers at God and a future state bear testimony to it – that whatever pretences so ever the generality of the world may make of receiving this doctrine in words and speculations, there are but very few who express an inward sense and serious belief of it by living like men that believe it, indeed.</p>
<p>Of that practical assent I shall take occasion to speak more largely hereafter. In the mean while, give me leave to lament that so little and so poor effects appear of an opinion capable of producing so many and so noble. For certainly there is not any one point, whatsoever, the persuasions of which can bring greater benefit or have a stronger influence upon mankind.  Again see page 281.</p>
<pb n="030" facs="334990"/>
<p>Tis a just reproof Seneca gives, ye live as if life were never to have an end. The frailty of your nature is never thought of. Or if it be, tis remembered to no purpose, for at the same time that your Fears are infinite and this proves you mortal, your desires are infinite too, as if you looked upon yourselves to be immortal. Again <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName>, page 282, quotes Seneca: a great part of our life, says Seneca, is run of in doing what we should not, much the greater in doing nothing at all and almost the whole of it in doing things by the by and such as are not our proper business. This is not what the apostle advised: study to be quiet and mind thine own business,<note type="editorial">1 Thessalonians 4:7</note> and is not this the most important, interesting business to study, to show ourselves approved in the sight of God, which is all in all? At last, again same book, page 283: some, say the philosophers, begin to live when they should make an end; others cease to live before ever they began. Among the many mischiefs that folly brings upon us, this is not the least: that it is always beginning to live. We think of business and intend to set about it, but make no progress at all, nor bring any thing to persecution, say <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName> <title>Of Wisdom</title>.</p>
<p>Is it not to be feared that on retrospection many many many will have to adopt the expressions of Grotius at last: alas, alas, I have consumed a great part of my time in laborious doing nothing, and many little else but sin, which is worse than nothing. But the poet [Edward Young] says their doing nothing is set down amongst their darkest deeds.</p>
<p>This is not giving all diligence to make our calling and election sure or working out the souls salvation with fear and trembling like the prophet who thus expressed himself: my lips quivered, my belly trembled that I ought rest in the day of trouble,<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:16</note> and again said another: oh, that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears, etc..<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 9:1</note> I will not give sleep to mine eyes nor slumber to mine eyelids till I find a place for the God of Jacob to dwell in etc.<note type="editorial">Psalm 132:4-5</note><note type="authorial" place="margin"> Very cold and I very poorly, can hardly keep up.</note></p>
<p>Again see <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName>, page 501: who (says Seneca) makes the gentleman the man whom nature hath disposed and as it were cut out for virtue? This man is well born, indeed, for the man wants nothing else to make him noble who hath a mind so generous that he can rise above and triumph over fortune, let his condition of life be what it will. Remember Habakkuk's words as to the gentleman: the Prophet David says thy gentleness hath made me great.<note type="editorial">Psalm 18:35</note> So true we see it is that it is righteousness exalts an individual as well as a whole nation, making men and women as bright stars in the firmament of the Lord's power, and as polished shafts in his quiver.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 49:2</note> (as the prophet expresses it). Brilliant stars of the first magnitude, so we read, that they that turn many to righteousness, shall shine as the stars forever and ever<note type="editorial">Daniel 12:3</note> Again see <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName> page 351, 1st part: is this query – Can any greater defect or misery be imagined incident to the Minds of Men than the neglect and disesteem of their best and most useful faculties? – is not this a vastly important, interesting query on which our happiness or unhappiness depends, the improving or neglecting our most useful faculties? Again see same Book of Wisdom, page 272: and the world ought to be humbled and reformed by a serious reflection how accessory men become to their own miseries and how obstinately fond they are of them when their very remedies are industriously turned into the worst of diseases. Is not this verified in men of martial spirits, zealous and fierce for war, and in many other things wherein men purse their own wills to their own destruction? For do not many die martyrs for money and some for pleasures, honors and the profits of this world and some in conformity to the fashions of it?</p>

Though it seemed hardish getting along, not like a full flowing tide, yet all seemed to end reputably and well, according to the times.

<p>See Erasmus's work, page XVIII: If the Christian religion be true than it must be of the highest importance to man individually. It is the first concern of the whole human race. In the book called <title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title>, there it is mentioned the dreadful persecution and destruction of the Albigenses, and I think <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> mentions it in his <title>No Cross No Crown, </title>and Erasmus in his book lately reprinted, page 148: two hundred thousand of these conscientious Christians and Catholics mixed with them were instantly butchered for the church. Again see Erasmus, page 145: seeing that the animosities of war produce so many and so shocking sufferings we think it incumbent on us to declare before all, both gods and men, that we are not in the least degree the cause of it. Only by pride cometh contention, says the wise man Solomon,<note type="editorial">Proverbs 13:10</note> and the apostle queries from whence comes wars and fightings. Come they (says he) not of your lusts?<note type="editorial">James 4:1</note> Then if we should query, is it I?, is it I?, how few should we find clear of pride and of indulging the lusts of the eye and the pride of life, the very seeds and cause of it. And as pride and the lusts of the eye prevail, so people come into a state like stubble, fully dry so that a little matter sets them all in a flame. As the Apostle says, behold what a great matter a little fire.<note type="editorial">James 3:5</note> kindereth as it is at this day when it is said not a nation to be named clear of war and dreadful battles and great slaughter and great destruction in some places. And as that of the Christian religion, as Erasmus says, it is the highest importance to men individually and the first concern of the whole human race. Yet see what <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, page first, in his preface: this is the decree as old as the world, but so it is that man mindeth nothing less than what he should most mind, etc. But although this is so generally the case with poor careless mortals through life, yet when they come to die then generally we see then religion is the first concern and highest importance. Then the cry is, let me die the death of the righteous etc, oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me a Savior, or I die a redeemer or I perish etc. So here we may see the state of poor careless mankind as to religion, see the ups and downs now as in days of old. We read they served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and of the elders that out lived Joshua but afterward there arose a generation that knew not the Lord<note type="editorial">Judges 2:7-10</note> Although it is too generally the case, we see as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> remarks, men mind nothing less than that which they should most mind and as one of our worthies said, few seem to be much careful about the state of their minds yet this hath been the awakening cry of many careless ones as I have heard, ten thousand worlds would I give if I had it in my power for peace with the Lord. I should be willing to die this very night if my peace was but made with the Lord. Ten thousand worlds one upon the back of another would not tempt me to live in the world as I have done. I desire to live no longer in this world, only on the terms of living better. A whole age were too little for the great work I have to do, now when I have not a prospect of living half a dozen hours, etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>See Erasmus's works, page 92: if we endeavor to be free ourselves from all that may encumber or impede our flight to Heaven, if we aspire with our most ardent wishes at celestial felicity, if we place our chief happiness in Christ alone, we have certainly in so doing made up our minds to believe that whatsoever is truly good, truly great, truly delightful, is to be found in his religion etc., etc. </p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1814-02-21"><dateline><date when="1814-02-21">21.</date></dateline><p> Second Month 1814. Our health, as <persName key="w65q5g7f">Samuel Fothergill</persName> says, is no more at our command than lengths of days. When I am sick He, if He please, can make me well and give me ease. It is said those who had the least share of religion were obliged to acknowledge a divine hand in the visitation and dreadful destruction in the time of the plague in London, both in the manner of its coming in and its progress, and in its going away so unexpectedly without any new cure or remedy being found out. When many thousands died in a day and all hope to fail, so I have heard <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> divers times mention the prevailing of that mortal fever in New England that would come and rage in a town or village, then go away without any remedy or cure or medicine found out. And this mortal fever has raged all round us east, north, west and south, very mortal in places and many round about us there have many died with symptoms of that disorder.</p>
<p>I have seen in an ancient book giving an account of the first settling of New England, that there was a very mortal sickness prevailed amongst the Indians from east to west and I asked an ancient friend Hannah Frinch if she ever heard of it. She said she did remember their saying they thought the Indians were all going to die, for they said they died about the woods like rotten sheep, and she told me that it was then said an Indian woman was found dead in the woods with a young child sucking at her breast.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon at our son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName> in the best and most profitable manner, and it is to be feared we seldom do so. I there picked up a little book, <title>A Sketch of the Denominations of the Christian World and of the character of the ancient first reformers from popery in divers different names and denominations of professing Christians and of their great sufferings and persecutions</title>. See page 150, of the French Protestants called Huguenots: in 1561 on the 24 of August 1572 happened the Massacre of Bartholomew when 70,000 throughout France were butchered with circumstances of aggravated cruelty. It began at Paris in the night of the festival of Bartholomew by secret orders from Charles the Ninth at the instigation of his mother the Queen Dowager Catherine De Medicis.</p>
<p>In 1598 Henry the 4th passed the famous Edict of France or of Nantz which secured to his old friends, the Protestants, the free exercise of their religion. This edict was cruelly revoked by Lewis [Louis] the 14th. Their churches were then razed to the ground, their persons insulted by the soldiery, and after the loss of innumerable lives, 500,000 valuable members of society were driven into exile. In Holland they built several places of worship and it appears they were a great and favored society of people. Oh, to see and to think what dreadful work there has been about religion might shew what a great favor it is be settled in peace in the true Christian religion, which never persecuted any but breaths peace on Earth and good will to all Men. So, as <persName key="w65q5g7f">Samuel Fothergill</persName> remarks, pride has ever been the cause and destruction of all the most flourishing kingdoms and empires that ever was known in the world, the downfall of one reformation after another, etc., etc.</p>
<p>See page 292, Reflections on the Different Denominations: truth indeed, moral and divine, flourishes only in the soil of freedom. There it shoots up and sheds its fruits for the healing of the nations. Civil and religious liberty are two of the greatest earthly blessings which Heaven can bestow on man. Thrice happy are the people who experience the benefits of good government unburdened by the impositions of oppression and who enjoy the sweets of liberty unimbittered by anarchy and licentiousness, and we should allow to others the same right of private judgment in religious matters which we claim and exercise ourselves.</p>
<p>Oh highly favored land of North America, what could have been done for us that has not been done and yet confusion and dissolation [desolation] seems to threaten us for want of humility and obedience. See <title>No Cross No Crown</title>, 89, on ambition and worldly mindedness: This makes Christianity so little loved of worldly men. Its kingdom is not of this world and though they speak it fair, it is the world they love, that without uncharitableness we may truly say people profess Christianity, but they follow the world; they are not for seeking the Kingdom of Heaven first (but see how their minds change at last) and the righteousness thereof and to trust God with the rest, but for securing to themselves the wealth and glory of this world and adjourning the cares of salvation to a sick bed and the extreme moments of life, if yet they believe a life to come. I add, doth not the general language of conduct contradict a belief in a life to come? It seemed to me this sentence is a clear representation of the state of the people now in our days. For do not many live careless, as if they were never to die? Oh, that they were wise that understood this, that they would consider their latter end again; oh, that there were such an heart in them to fear me always that so it might be well with them and their children forever. Blessed is the man that fearest all ways the fear of the Lord that is wisdom,<note type="editorial">Job 28:28</note> keeps the heart clean, a fountain of life which preserves from the snares of death. But is it not too much banished on our days?</p></div>

<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Burlington Quarterly Meeting very cold again.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1814-02-28"><dateline><date when="1814-02-28">28.</date></dateline><p> Though very cold weather, I felt an engagement of mind to attend a large school near us. There was a large number of people, between 20 and 30 wagons. The teacher and school bears a great name. It's a mixture of Friends and others, but our rules has not the ascendancy there. The house was very full, crowded with scholars and spectators, many young people and a number of elderly ones. At these times they have run much into the practice of selecting pieces, getting them by rote and saying them before the congregation. Some of their pieces are serious, composed of good matter, but many of them tend much to lightness and very much provoke or excite laughter so that at several times they were all in a titter or giggle of laughter. The young women very gay and fashionable and also the young men. There was, I thought, very much that opposed and oppressed the right spirit and yet not altogether destitute of that, neither. The young people displayed or discovered great ingenuity, gifts, bright parts, talents, genius, and extensive capacities. Indeed, I do think their carryings on and actings bordered very much on the manners of the play, actors in their theatres and tragedies, and yet for all this at last as some of us endeavored to keep serious, solid and weighty. We had an open, satisfactory time amongst them, owning and savory and, to me, strengthening. The scoffer and gainsayer silenced as far as appeared, and all ended well and appeared to be well accepted, although they were cautioned against introducing any thing amongst them that would tend to lightness. The teacher is a man of great abilities and great qualifications for school keeping but has and does yet at times very much hurt himself with strong drink. We read in Scripture that mankind were first created pure, but they have sought out many inventions, many, many, many, indeed, to their own great destruction. See <title>Remarks on the Different Sects</title>, page 292, the words of the celebrated John Locke: no way whatsoever that I shall ever walk in against the dictates of my conscience will ever bring me to the mansions of the blessed; faith only and inward sincerity are the strings that procure acceptance with God. Where the treasure is there will the heart be also.</p>
<p>Oh, how are they at their school, as above mentioned, spending their time and labor for that which doth not profit! Pleasing themselves with that which is not durable and permanent and lasting when they might be favored and honored with the company of the King of Saint, who promised to be with the faithful and dwell in them and walk in them. As the prophet said to the people of Judah and Benjamin, the Lord is with you whilst you be with him,<note type="editorial">2 Chronicles 15:2</note> and David to his son Solomon also<note type="editorial">1 Chronicles 28:20</note> Oh how unwise, how infatuated, to neglect so great a favor! May we not adopt the language of old: oh, ye foolish people and unwise, do ye thus requite the Lord<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 32:6</note> as to forsake the fountain of living waters and hew to themselves cisterns that can hold no water<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:13</note>: forsake the waters of Shiloh and rejoice in something else that cannot profit in the time of greatest need when every other source fails? Unwise, indeed, thus infatuated, are not a great part of the world, forsaking the waters of Shiloh and rejoicing in something else? See <persName key="w6gv6crg">[John] Comly's</persName> <title>Spelling Book</title>, page 106: the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. With this constantly on your minds much advice will not be needful, and without it none will be effectual. If you live in this fear it will regulate every thoughts, words, and actions. 190: for this is a certain truth, that God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him. The youth whose mind is thus influenced and who is desirous of contemplating the goodness of the Almighty will feel a sense of gratitude that he has a capacity given him of attaining to that most excellent of all enjoyments, a union with his Maker.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Some of those who have opposed the highest truths and forsaken the fountain of all their blessings have been constrained to acknowledge that is best to be serious and religious. Watch and be sober, said the apostle.<note type="editorial">1 Thessalonians 5:6</note></note>
<p>Oh what a pity it is that this is so little considered, seeing it would lead to such a state of peace and safety here. Yea, happiness and blessedness here and hereafter. See Apocrasy [Apocrypha] Wisdom of Solomon VII, 25 verse: For she is the breath of the power of God and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the Almighty; therefore, can no defiled thing fall in her. 26: For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness. And being but one she can do all things new, and in all ages entering into holy souls she maketh them friends of God and prophets. Is not all this verified in the humble, faithful, and obedient?</p></div>

<note type="authorial" place="margin"> so poorly I could not go to our Select Meeting.</note>
<p>See Barclay's <title>Apology</title>, page 22: so great things (says Arathusius) doth our Savior daily; he draws unto piety, persuades unto virtues, teaches immortality, excites to the desire of Heavenly things, reveals the knowledge of the Father, inspires power against death and shows himself to every one. Inspires power against death, mark that. Is it not the one thing needful more to be desired than all this world can afford? Yea, more than ten thousand worlds as divers have expressed it at last. For what would it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul,<note type="editorial">Mark 8:36</note> and what would a man give in exchange for his soul? If we obtain the favor of this power, it is enough – we gain all. If we lose it, we lose all. Is it not strange that mankind should so little consider it and treat it with such trifling indifferency until it is too late? Thine eye shall see thy teacher, thine ear shall hear a voice behind thee, etc. said the prophet.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 30:20-21</note> and again it is shown unto the man what is good and what the Lord thy God requires of thee to do justly and walk humbly and to do to others we would they should do to us<note type="editorial">Micah 6:8</note> Ye have a more sure word of prophecy etc..<note type="editorial">2 Peter 1:19</note> The law of the Lord is pure converting the soul; the law of the land is perfect, enlightening the eyes and making wise the simple. When thou gest [goest] it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. For the law is a lamp and the commandment is a light and the reproofs of instuction the way of life,<note type="editorial">Proverbs 6:22-23</note> the law written in the heart, the law of the Spirit of life which Paul said had sat him free from the law of sin and death<note type="editorial">Romans 8:2</note> and, as Samuel told Saul, obedience is better than sacrifice and to hearken to the voice of the Lord than the fat of rams.<note type="editorial">1 Samuel 15:22</note> Man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.<note type="editorial">Matthew 4:4</note>Now if we take the subjects into consideration, what a large field for contemplation, meditation and consideration, to consider the different effects on mankind - a due attention and observation of these passages of Scripture in all ages down to this day – and what influence they have had amongst men, evidently and manifestly tending to their highest happiness and safety in this world and that which is to come and the effects of disregarding them and treating them as fables in a trifling manner. And, yet, notwithstanding the effects are so evident and so clear and so vastly important and interesting to mankind, yet how are they disregarded by many until it is too late! The destruction of the old world by the flood; the destruction of Sodom by fire; the earth opening her mouth and swallowing up Corah [Korah], Dathan and Abiram; the multitudes slain in the wars and by pestilence and famine; and so down to this day, the many thousands of the poor Africans, the black people, and in the wards in Europe the many thousands that have been slain, and persecution, it is said, has thinned the world of fifty million of human beings.</p>
<p>So see here the dismal effect of a disregard to this righteous principle, and, on the other hand, see the blessed and happy effects of a due regard to it, as the primitive Christians were told they had passed from death to life and had come to the new and heavenly Jerusalem, to the city of the saints, solemnity and much more to that effects. The one tends to the building up in the most holy faith and the other to destruction. As David said, they have burnt up all the synagogues of God in the land,<note type="editorial">Psalm 74:8</note> and many times since what destruction and ruin has been acted on the poor Christians in nations and ages since, banishing and destroying their places of worship, as in our first Friends. When they pulled down their meeting houses, they met on the rubbish, and in the time of last war, our meeting houses were threatened of being pulled down. One said he would go at it as free as ever; he went to splitting of rails. What has been may be; like causes produce like effect and every tree its own kind of fruits.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Very cold weather. I but poorly.</note>
<p>There is a spirit in man (said Elihu),<note type="editorial">Job 32:1-8</note> and it is the inspiration of the Almighty giveth it an understanding. Now this righteous principle in all this divine inspiration and illumination and revelation, and consider the effects of it when and where it is rightly attended to and the consequence and effects of disregarding and disobeying it. It is evident it has, does and will turn the hearts of men as a man turns a water course. It turns the hearts of men (in a state of nature like a wilderness) into a fruitful field bringing forth its fruit in its season and causes the desert and solitary places to blossom as the rose. So we read I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley,<note type="editorial">Song of Solomon 2:1</note> etc.</p>
<pb n="035" facs="334995"/>
<p>But when and wheresoever this divine inspiration is disregarded and disobeyed, the hearts of men that are like a well watered garden or fruitful field are turned into a barren wilderness. As <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> said when he first came forth to labor in the Lord's vineyard, the world was like a wilderness and the spirits of men like devouring wolves, bears, lions and tigers, ready to devour him, and all the lambs and sheep of Christ full of hissing serpents and stinging scorpions. As the prophet expresses, they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web. He that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 59:5 </note> Do we not evidently see it to be so, and that this is the different effects between a right and wrong spirit? Well might David pray that the Lord would create a clean heart and renew a right spirit within him, see Matthew 12:34. Christ calls them a generation of vipers. For we may see in our days, as in former days, the dreadful effects of the consequence of a want of the government and guidance of a right spirit, see :<note type="editorial">2 Chronicles 15:3</note> now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God and without a teaching priest and without law. 4: but when they in their trouble did turn unto the Lord God of Israel and sought him he was found of them 5: and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the inhabitance of the countries, and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city, for God did vex them with all adversity. So now in our day, for want of attention to that righteous principle, which alone can regulate all and bring all into right order, we seem now to be threatened with confusion and desolation. Oh, it seems people did not consider the effects of this little seed, the reproofs of instruction, the way of life, that – after all these wars, blood shed, wherein the earth hath been drenched with and deluged with blood and rivers tinged with and dyed with blood – would bring people into right order and nation no more lift up sword against nation nor learn war any more. But as Job of old said, the life of man is a warfare on earth, a Christian life a continual warfare and as we read no discharge in that war.</p>
<p>Oh, what great and blessed attainment to have to say with the apostle, I have fought the good fight; I have kept the faith, hence forth there is a crown of righteousness laid up for me and not only for me but for all them that love the appearance of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ [2 Timothy 4:78]. Oh how triumphantly and gloriously do these die saying, Oh, death, where is thy sting? Oh, grave, where is thy victory?<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 15:55</note> See Isaiah 40 chapter, 2 verse. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished, that her inequity is pardoned, for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins. See <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn's</persName> <title>No Cross No Crown</title>, page 260, the sayings of Heraclitus: I have overcome pleasures, I have overcome riches; I have overcome ambition; I have mastered flattery. Fear hath nothing to object against me; drunkenness hath nothing to charge upon me. I have won the garland in fighting against these enemies, the worst of a man's house. And the promise to the overcomers was and is, he that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life that stands in the midst of the paradise of God and of the hidden manna, etc., etc..<note type="editorial">Revelation 2:7 and 17</note> One act of triumph over the temper is worth a million over our fellow creatures, and the perfect dominion of our mind is more advantageous and laudable than the dominion over provinces and nations.

He is more a prince that rules himself than he who nations keeps in awe; who yield to that which doth their souls convince shall never need another law.

<p>Yet, although the Apostle foresaw and foretold of a time of great falling away (from primitive purity) which came to pass, until great darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the people, yet it pleased the Lord to visit poor mankind in this most miserable, dark, benighted state, to enlighten the minds of one and another, to see into the darkness, idolatry, and superstition they had fallen in to in this dark, bewildered, benighted state. They had fallen into for want of taking heed to the light that shined in their hearts to lead them, guide them, and preserve them in safety and right order, as we may see in the book called <title>Rise and Progress of Friends in Ireland</title>, where the progressive steps of the reformation are faithfully pointed out and how many valiants there were raised up to testify against the gross errors that were (in this time of darkness and disobedience) crept into the church! But as it is there observed, these were always sure to do this at the hazard of their lives. And as the prophets and apostles most if not all suffered martyrdom, so did these first reformers with thousands and millions of their followers. Now it can be nothing short of the hand and arm of almighty power that hath brought forward and carried on the great work of the reformation so far, through all the opposition of envious men and devils. And it appears to have been the settled firm belief and faith of many of the most enlightened, that the Lord will carry on this great work through and over all opposition. And these first reformers were favored to see and foretell and prophecy of the still greater and greater breaking forth of the light of the reformation. As the great master told the people in his day, your father Abraham desired to see my day and he saw it and was glad. So it seems clear that many in ages and nations since have been favored to see it. <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty</persName> in his diary mentions the prophecy of Jerome of Prague: viz. a new people shall be raised up that shall renounce the glory of this world and seek after the cultivation of the inward man. They shall have ministers raised up amongst themselves and elders and others officers in the church. They shall grow and flourish in the truth whilst those of human invention shall consume away like a moth. This did in a wonderful manner come to pass in and soon after the days of <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName>. Many many indeed very powerful ministers were raised up and even boys and girls from 9 years old to 14, 15, to 20 and sons of thunder that made earth to shake and tremble and see <persName key="w6s505g1">Samuel Bownas</persName> takes notice of a prophecy of William Dell in page 108, saying he would appeal to the next generation – but especially that people whom God hath and shall form by his spirit. They have the anointing for their teacher and the lamb to be their light and he thinks the author plainly pointed out our Friends society of people. In the writing of Thomas Bromley, called The Way to the Sabbath of Rest, the words or prophecy of one Moor seems very confident that the time will come when all religious denominations or sects will surely be dissolved and brought into one. And Robert Barclay at the conclusion of his <title>Apology</title> says, and although we be few in number in respect of others and weak as to outward strength, which we also altogether reject, and foolish if compared with the wise ones of this world, yet as God hath prospered us, notwithstanding much opposition, so will he yet do that neither the art, wisdom, nor violence of men or devils shall be able to quench that little spark that hath appeared, but it shall grow to the consuming of whatsoever shall stand up to oppose it. The mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. Yea he hath risen in a small remnant, shall arise and go on by the same arm of power in his spiritual manifestation until he hath conquered all his enemies, until all the kingdoms of the earth become the kingdom of Christ Jesus Then nation will not lift up sword against nation nor learn war any more and the lion and the lamb lay down together etc.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 2:4</note> Oh blessed and happy days after all this dismal destruction, bloodshed, misery, and dreadful confusion!</p>

<p>Great peace have they that love thy law, said the prophet David.<note type="editorial">Psalm 119:165</note> My peace I give unto you; my peace I leave with you. Not as the world giveth give I, said the great master.<note type="editorial">John 14:27</note> That peace we read of that passes all human understanding – <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> calls it the King of Kings his peace. Who can set forth the excellency of a peaceful and tranquil mind? It is a paradise, say the Spaniard, according to <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron's</persName> account. One would wonder (said <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> my dear cousin on his death bed) all the world did not seek after peace of mind. It is such an excellent treasure at such a time as this; what would all the world avail me now if had not this peace? And this hath been the language of very many at last: some lamenting the want of it and some rejoicing in the possession of it. Is it not the one thing most needful, the pearl of great price, a precious jewel, more to be desired than silver, and the gain thereof than all the gold of ophir, which all together could not pay any ones passage from earth to Heaven? Oh, how prone we are to pursue lying vanities and forsake our own mercies!<pb n="037" facs="334997"/></p>
<p>Again, Paul, I think it is, thus exhorts, follow after those things that make for peace and those things whereby one may edify another [Romans 14:19]. Now is not there means and a way provided for all in all ages to attain to and obtain this greatest highest felicity? As Erasmus says, he that wisheth a man health wisheth him a valuable blessing but he that wisheth him peace wisheth him the highest felicity of human beings– so Seneca and divers others that I have read of agreed. To be favored with peace of mind and to obtain the approbations, union and communion with our great creator is the highest pitch of Christian perfection. Although the fields should yield no meat, said Habakkuk, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation etc..<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:17</note></p>
<p>Now here, as I take it, is the means provided for mankind to attain to this blessed and happy experience is clearly pointed out by <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> in his advice to his children at the conclusion of his <title>Select Works</title>: I (says he) have chosen to speak to you in the language of Scripture, which is that of the Holy Ghost, the spirit of truth and wisdom that wanted no art of direction of man to speak by and express itself fitly to man's understanding, but yet that blessed principle, the eternal word I began with to you and which is that light, spirit, and grace, and truth. I have exhorted you to in all his holy appearances or manifestations in yourselves, by which all things were at first made and man enlightened to salvation: is Pythagoreus, great light and salt of ages; Anaxagoras, divine mind; Socrates, good spirit; time in unbegotten Timaeus, unbegotten principle and author of all light; Hierons, God in man; Platos, eternal ineffible and perfect principle of truth; Zenos, maker and father of all; and Plotinus, root of the soul, who as they thus styled the eternal word for the appearance of it in man, they wanted not very significant words. A domestic god or God within, says Hieron, Pythagoras, Epictetus and Seneca; genius, angel, or guide, says Socrates and Timeus.</p>
<p>The divine principle in man, says Plotin. The divine power and reason the infallible and immortal law in the minds of men, says Philo; and the law and living rule of the mind, the interior of the soul and everlasting foundation of virtue says Plutarch, etc., says <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName>, conclusion of his <title>Select Works</title> and page the last, 861, in his <title>Advice to His Children</title>: it is a noble measure sufficient to regulate the whole. They that have it are easy as well as safe; no extreme prevails, the world is kept at arms end, and such have power over their own spirits, which gives them the truest enjoyment of themselves and what they have: a dominion greater than that of empires. O may this virtue be yours! You have grace from God for that end and it is sufficient. Employ it, and you cannot miss of temperance nor neither the truest happiness in all your conduct.</p>
<p>See again page 849: For God is and will be with his people in his holy dispensation we are now under and which is now amongst us unto the end of days. It shall grow and increase in gifts, graces, and power, and luster for it is the last and unchangeable one. And blessed are your eyes if they see it and your ears if they hear it and your hearts if they understand it, which I pray that you may to God's glory and your eternal comfort. Penn's Advice to his Children and as <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> lately said it was his faith and belief that as long as there was men on the Earth there would be some professing and maintaining our principles or to that effect. Again see Penn's Advice to His Children, page 850: mind an inward sense upon doing any thing. When you read the Scriptures, remark the notablest passages as your spirits are most touched; in a common-place book with that sense or opening which you receive. For they come not by study or in the will of man no more than the Scripture did and they may be lost by carelessness and overgrowing thoughts and business of this life. So in perusing any other good or profitable book yet rather meditate than read much. This Advice of <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> to His Children of keeping a common-place book, etc., and to keep an account of every day, though a day should require but a line – he said many advantages flow from it, was what first put me upon thus keeping such a common place book, as he calls it, nearly in my first beginning with it. My dear cousin <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> was here and I shewed it to him and he seemed much pleased with and encouraged me in it and once in company with <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> he told me I should keep such a book, and I told him I did, and he seemed pleased to hear it, very much encouraged it. But sometimes I am ready to think of burning it all, as some have done in times of poverty. But sometimes it seems very agreeable to look over it. But, alas, when I recur to this query what lack I yet, I am ready to conclude that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1814-03-10"><dateline><date when="1814-03-10">10.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. Our Monthly Meeting. I was ready to conclude it was hardly worth while for me to go, but the weather clearing up and I got better, I did go, and there I found <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> again, and an highly favored, open, owning time it was. Both meetings held from 10 to half past 3 and I was favored to sit it out. <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> had a great deal to say in both meetings, and I had a considerable share in the labor with him in the first meeting. I had like to have been up before him with the same words he mentioned. We were nearly united in the labor, seemingly as if we had been brought up at one school together, exactly suited, as it used formerly to be with my dear old friend, <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName> and <persName key="w68m543d">John Simson</persName>, seemingly to suit one another's turn. Christopher's testimony was very savory, against the many deficiencies prevailing amongst us.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1814-03-11"><dateline><date when="1814-03-11">11.</date></dateline><p> I and my daughter <persName key="w6136j8n">Hannah</persName> went to Evesham Monthly Meeting. <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> was pretty much shut up first sitting; only appeared in supplication on the queries. C.H. had a good deal to say, but I thought the waters were low and a want of life and savor, which seems to be the state of that meeting. Christopher and I went in to the women's meeting and had a pretty open, satisfactory time with them. He was very pertinent and lively against the prevailing fashions and conformity to this world's ways, etc.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1814-03-12"><dateline><date when="1814-03-12">12.</date></dateline><p> Seventh Day. Christopher went to Upper Evesham Monthly Meeting, and I was informed had very acceptable service amongst them. Now in the Ninth Month he is about to marry a young woman in Bucks County, one Miller.

<div type="entry" n="1814-03-13"><dateline><date when="1814-03-13">13.</date></dateline><p> First Day. <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs> and I and daughter <persName key="w6136j8n">Hannah</persName> met <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> at Cropwell. It was a very large full crowded meeting, and Christopher was raised in great eminence, although the waters seemed low at first. I thought it was like throwing a little water in a pump (as R. [Robert] Barclay expresses it) and working it; it brings up the rest. So Christopher was favored to evidently show his certificate signed and sealed by highest authority. We dined at Joseph Rogers's, where was a number of young Friends with them and the family. We had a good opportunity together. Then we and Christopher and his companion, <persName key="w69h6c86">Job Collins</persName>, came home with us to lodge, and a very agreeable satisfactory time we had together.</p></div>

We had a meeting at their schoolhouse. A very stormy day, the meeting small. A number of Methodists were there and appeared very attentive. Christopher was highly favored to show his best certificate, signed and sealed this afternoon. Had a meeting at the county poor house, between fifty and a hundred paupers. I am told Christopher had a very open, satisfactory time with them. It was a very stormy time; I, poorly, did not go with them. This evening we had a very satisfactory time in the family.</p></div>

His wife died with the prevailing fever not very long ago. He seems like something picked up in the wilderness: not brought up at the feet of Gamaliel nor at the academics schools or colleges, but, like the prophet formerly, by opening his ear to discipline and the tongue of the learned is given him to speak a word in season to the weary traveler [Isaiah 50:4]. Has a very clear pleasing delivery and an uncommon, free, open, sociable, loving turn towards all and so travels with very great acceptance. An evident sign that mercy and goodness yet following and striving with the people, in thus raising up instruments to labor to turn the people from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to the power of the Lord. Heard of the death of three old Negroes. One died very sudden. Old Dinah dropped down in her house and died instantly.</p></div>

I went to our meeting (with all our family except our hired black man) under a feeling that I was ready to say in my heart, woe is me for I am undone, so I felt under a sense and feeling of my frailties and weakness, yet not overcome.

<p>Seventh Day. Fine and warm, some stripped off of their cloth. Next day grows cold, 2nd snow storm. When I was at Nathan Lippincott's at Timbercreek with <persName key="w6dw29hq">Christopher Healy</persName> I laid hands of the writings of Thomas Bromley, called <title>The Way to the Sabbath of Rest</title>, and of the journeys of the children of Israel, and of extraordinary dispensation together with the writings of Thomas Hartley and William Dell. Truly altogether excellent. Many sentences I could and should write down if I attended to <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn's</persName> <title>Advice to his Children</title> as I have observed on the last leaf. So many sentences were so striking, so excellent. I have read this book some years ago and much recommend it and wish they were more published. See Apocrypha, Eccleciasticus 11:10 verse: look at the generations of old and see; did ever any trust in the Lord and was confounded? Or did any abide in his fear and was forsaken? Or whom did he ever despise that called upon him?</p>
<p>And see Isaiah 24:16: from the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs glory, even glory, to the righteous, and that in every nation, kindred, color, tongue, or people.</p>
<p>In a public paper it is said: died at Jamaica (at Falmouth) on Tuesday 15 ult: Ann Sylvester, a free black woman at the very advanced age of 133 years. She lived in the neighborhood of Duncan at the time of the earthquake, which happened at Port Royal in the year 1692, and from her own account must have been about 15 years old. She had at one time children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to the number of 82. It is somewhat remarkable she never lost a tooth from the time she was grown up, nor ever wore spectacles as her eyesight was sufficiently strong to do common needlework till about a fortnight before her death. She was a motherly, humane creature, was much beloved among her neighbors and retained her faculties to within a few minutes before her death. Thus, as the prophet said, from the uttermost parts of the earth have we heard songs, even glory, to the righteous.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 24:16</note> We have very much such an account of an old black woman who said she could remember the first house for worship built in Philadelphia. She died a few years ago, upwards one hundred years old. Richard Dill [Dillwyn?], visiting families at Moorestown when we were there reading the account of her, said she had ferried him over the river at Dunkin's Ferry divers time or a many times.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1814-03-24"><dateline><date when="1814-03-24">24.</date></dateline><p> Third Month. Fifth Day. At our meeting. Cold and stormy snow and rain. The meeting very small but not the poorest to me; helped, as I thought, beyond all expectation and so came off without condemnation but with satisfaction, which is more than ten thousands of witnesses as to the outward.</p>
<p>See Bromley, page 4, speaking of the narrow way that leads to life and of the cherubim flaming sword whose office is to cut off all corruption from the soul so that the least grain of selfishness or flesh cannot enter the Kingdom of heaven – we are to be stripped of all the riches of corrupt nature and [leaves off there].</p>
<p>See d<supplied>itt</supplied>o page 37th: selfishness without much self-denial and watchfulness may spring up in a new dress after very great and high attainments and very great favors. 2: so also they may break in upon us from large and eminent gifts of the spirit, and we may take too much complacency in the pleasant fruition of them, even to an hindrance of our looking up to the fountain as all in all. And soon very excellent indeed, for after we have been upon the mount of divine visions and openings we may expect 109: to be led into a more humbling dispensation to (Hadarah), great fear and trembling that so we might not be elevated but still keep lowly under the cross. Saint Paul seemed in some such state, Corinthians 2 and 3rd: I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. 110: When it pleaseth the high and holy one he can let out such terrors upon us for our humiliation. I heard <persName key="w6b38kp0">Thomas Ross</persName>, a worthy minister, once say it is a great thing to keep self down, a very great thing indeed. If it be true (which I believe it is), he that conquers himself conquers his greatest enemy because then his greatest enemy, the Devil, hath nothing in him to work upon. Is it not at this door, [the] self, the subtle twining serpent enters? And see what dreadful work he has made among the children of men.</p>
<pb n="040" facs="335000"/>
<p>See also in page 113 of Bromley's Journeys of the Children of Israel, the effects of self-will exalting itself against God's will in the dreadful case of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. Tempting us to do so, which to comply with is as the sin of witchcraft, 1 of Samuel 15: 23, in opposition to which any constant business or work is to break our wills and labor after a moral annihilation of them, as ever remembering that of our Saviour. If any man will or come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me, Luke 9:23. This is the true way of preserving ourselves from the sins of Israel. Page 239: in giving the spirit power over the flesh to subdue it and to check its wandering imaginations and earthly affections, that so, these being in order, the spirit may enjoy divine silence in conversing with God and angels. For it is in reference to this inward man or spirit of our minds that we are said, Ephesians 2:6, to sit in heavenly places. See same book, Thomas Hartly's words: oh, ye sons of men, turn your eyes to the great bedlam of the world, where its valaries are running mad at such a rate after folly and riot, where invention is racked to lull conscience asleep, and where millions are racking themselves to spiritual slumber in the cradle of death, and treat every faithful watchman that sounds the alarm to rouse them from their false peace as the enemy of their repose. Cast your eyes I say on this theatre of vice and frolic this fair of vanity, where Prince Abaddon holds his perpetual jubilee and say which of these two schools, Christianity or the world, turns out the greater number of mad folks. Which would an angel, an angel, pronounce most rational and sound in mind? The sordid race of Manmonists, the giddy tribes of pleasure-seekers and the fantastic tribes of fashion followers? Or the poor, broken hearted Christian lamenting his sins and misery and in the power of divine grace working out his salvation with fear and trembling and following a desired Jesus through mockery and derision to eternal blessedness and glory? If you are not of the number of the infatuated, you cannot hesitate a moment to resolve the question a right, for wisdom is justified of her children.</p>
<p>So Thomas Hartley concludes his discourse on mistakes concerning religion with the words of Dr. Moore's, preface to that of godliness, viz.:</p>
<p>There shall be most certainly a time when the sun of righteousness being risen, Egyptian mists and darkness shall be dispersed, when all the filth and dross of the church shall be consumed and purged away by the ardor of divine love, when all barbarity of manners and filthy superstitions and idolatries shall be sent into the lake of fire and brimstone, when finally Calvinism, Lutheranism, Popery, and whatever other distinctions shall be melted down into one (which shall be instead of all) truly Catholic Apostolic Philadelphianism. Which times that God would hasten and there unto incline the hearts of Christian princes and people ought to be the fervent desire and prayer of all good men.</p>
<p>Same book, next follow the works of William Dell. Page 87 says: for faith is a work of the spirit of power, etc. 88: and thus the Holy Spirit is a spirit of faith in us and so a spirit of power. For unbelief keeps a man in himself, but faith carries a man out to Christ. Now there is no man weaker than he that rests on himself, and there is no man stronger than he that forsakes himself and rests on Christ. And so a man through the power of faith is able both to do and endure the selfsame things which himself did endure. Page 109: all Christians stand in need of the power of the spirit to enable them to perform duties, to perform them aright – that is, spiritually. For spiritual duties may be performed for the outward work, carnally, and in such duties there is no strength but weakness, because there is none of the spirit in them. For there is no power in any duty except there be something of the spirit in duty. There is no more power in praying, nor in preaching, nor in hearing, nor in meditation, nor in reading, nor in resisting of evil, nor in doing good, nor in any duty of sanctification or of mortification than there is of the spirit in them and according to the measure of the spirit in each duty is the measure of power in the duty. If there be none of the spirit in a man's duties there is no power at all in them, but only weakness and deadness and coldness and unprofitableness. If a little of the spirit, there is a little power, and that duty that is most spiritual is most powerful, and therefore St. Paul saith, I will pray with the spirit and will sing with the spirit etc..<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 14:15</note> And all the worship of the faithful is in the spirit, Phip. 3:3. We are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and have no confidence in the flesh, so that there is no more power in any duty than there is of the spirit in it,and there is no more acceptance of any duty with God than there is power in it. Same book, last page but 2, penitence illustrated etc. Had I now a thousand worlds I would give them all for one year more that might present unto God one year of such devotion and good works as I never before so much as intended.
<pb n="041" facs="335001"/>
See page 16 (the last page in that book) of Bromley's: I could have called in as many helps, have practiced as many rules, and been taught as many methods of holy living as of thriving in my shop had I but so intended or desired it. Oh, my Friends! A careless life unconcerned and unattentive to the duties of Religion is so without all excuse, so unworthy of the mercies of God, such a shame to the sense and reason of our minds, that I can hardly conceive a greater punishment than for a man to be thrown into the state that I am in to reflect upon it.</p>
<p>Their doing nothing is set down amongst their darkest deeds, says Young, the poet, on resignation.</p>
<p>See Bromley, page 471: thus St. Paul asserts the Galatians to have been bewitched, chapter 3:1, Satan showed his artifices in leavening their minds with erroneous principles, notwithstanding they believed and had received the spirit, verse 2.<note type="editorial">Galatians 3:2</note> And by parity of reason all those are under some degree of this enchantment who stick in outward worship and outward ceremonies, observations, whither invented by men or instituted by God, I say, who stick in them as to neglect any degree of internal piety or purity, holiness, mortification and universal obedience. For as St. Paul assures the Galatians, In Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision,<note type="editorial">Galatians 5:6</note> but a new creature.</p>
<p>Is it not to be feared many of all sort content themselves with the performance of a round of religious duties without the evident renewings of life? If it were not so, surely there would be more of the evident tokens of that. We read of the ointment of his right hand bewrayeth itself.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 27:16</note> As the damsel challenged Peter, saying, thou are one of them; thy speech bewrayeth thee.<note type="editorial">Matthew 26:73</note> This, I have thought of late, is much wanting amongst many, if not all – even the fore rank amongst us hiding their talents in the earth instead of letting our lights so shine before men that others seeing our good works might glorify our Heavenly Father. I have of late thought, I have seen if this was more seen, the ointment of his right hand betrayeth itself, there would be a right gathering of the people to the peaceable, Shiloh and they would flock to us as doves to the windows.</p>
<p>See Bromley, page 168: one species of mystical idolatry is the immoderate love of ourselves, 2 Timothy 3:2, or the letting out that fullness of affection to any creature which is only due to God whom we are to love with our whole heart, but nothing else so; thirdly, the reposing too much confidence in ourselves or in any other person or things besides God, whither it be riches, honor, power, on wisdom, etc. And see Bromley, 229 of extraordinary dispensations, speaking of the administration of angels and the good we receive by them. After setting forth and proving by Scripture the many and great advantages we receive by them, he says, but is it so that we enjoy such happy privileges by their constant attendance. How then should we carry ourselves before these bright flames of fire, these chariots of the great Jehovah, which carry God's name in them? If princes were continually conversant with us, how should we fear to commit any absurdity in carriage! But how much greater are the angels than earthly princes! Zach 6 and 4 Danl. 10:17: how cautious then should we be in our conversation before them, how much declining all speculation, and active pollutions, all vain imaginations, uncomely speeches, idle discourses. How ready are we to please even the unreasonable humors of those we converse with that so we may avoid offence. How then are we obliged to suit ourselves to those who, besides their protecting us, are so pure and spiritual that we are sure to lose nothing, yea to gain much, by our conformity to them! Do not they rejoice at the conversion of sinners and delight in our happiness! Ought not we then to rejoice in affording them cause of joy, and delight to delight them? For it is extremely unjust to retaliate nothing for their kindness to us. And how can we express ourselves to them but by oft and serious reflections upon them, by living like them in constant communion with their and our God and with them in him; as likewise by discoursing, praying, and singing together. For in such things they delight and take much notice of our carriage in divine worship. 1 Corinthians 11:10: which place, though it unfold a deep mystery, yet it also discovereth the presence of angels in holy assemblies and our duty to demean ourselves accordingly. See Bromley 108: and one reason why so few enjoy such things to strengthen themselves and others is in that most stick in some part of the eternal life and have the powers of their souls weakened and chained up by it. They have not wholly left Egypt but adhere to some part of this lower world with irregular desires, yet undiscernibly under the disguise of Christian liberty, etc., etc.</p></div>

But providence having favored him with considerable substance, he imagined he transgressed in having everything too fashionable and to rich, and did not serve his maker with his substance as he ought to have done. This was a great load upon him. Page 190 he says, I gave this poor, despairing friend another visit and found him much out of order, which made it unpleasant to be with him.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> This, as far as appear, was in 1726, 1727, or 1728.</note>
<p>Oh, for the way everlasting, which David prayed for, the sure foundation which stands the storms. On page 185, Bownas says: this evening as I was going to bed, about ten at night, there was an exceeding great earthquake that made a noise like the driving of carts or wagons over an uneven causeway. It continued about 2 minutes to the great surprise of the people. It was felt about fifteen hundred miles, as was after computed and was thought by calculation. Was not quite three hours in going that space. Page 190, he says he had intelligence by letters from his friends, further accounts of this great earthquake before noted how that at Newbury, Haverill, Aimsbury and places adjacent it continued for fourteen days and was felt a long way on the banks of the Moremack [Merrimack, Bownas says Maramack] River. The account was confirmed by many who felt it, who declared themselves afraid to remain in their houses during the several shocks, which returned every twenty four hours, continuing about the space of three minutes. The inhabitants did much blame themselves for their pride and luxury, taking this to be a judgment upon them for those things. Our first Friends wrote long epistles against pride and luxury, and frequently used these expression: surely will not the Lord visit for these things. And how many since have taken their afflictions to be as judgments for their pride and disobedience in these things? Many, many indeed, I have noted. And see <persName key="w6kf2phb">Thomas Chalkley's</persName> journal page 300. In the year 1737 in the forepart of the tenth month: the night 11 hour before he parted with John Fothergill after his third visit to America, was an earthquake which was the greatest known in this province – the whole city of Philadelphia being shaken, and most parts of the adjacent provinces, though little or no damage done thereby, which shows the abundant mercy of a merciful God, as also, if it were the pleasure of his will, how soon he can lay cities and countries waste and desolate and bury thousands in a moment. But notwithstanding the mighty power of the eternal Jehovah, oh, how hard are the people's hearts and how they hate to be reformed and how unconcerned are the inhabitants of the land about their eternal peace and well being! This is really lamentable. Oh, how do earthly-mindedness, pride, covetousness and drunkenness abound with many other evils which were scarcely known amongst the first settlers of this peaceful and now plentiful land of Pennsylvania. So for Chalkley. See Numbers 16:32, the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up Korah. Dathan and Abiram, Psalms 106:17.</p>

<p>See my memorandum 9 of 1 Month 1812, see Seneca's Morals page 378, meditations on earthquakes and consolations against them. He says in Asia twelve cities were swallowed up in one night. And see <persName key="w66696rh">[Lindley] Murray's</persName> <title>English Reader</title>, page 138: the earthquake at Catanea fifty-four cities with

with an incredible number of villages were either destroyed or greatly damaged. Catanea in particular was overthrown, and although the earthquake did not continue above three minutes, yet near nineteen thousands of the inhabitants perished in the ruins, and not a footstep of its former magnificence was to be seen. Seneca says scarcely a greater instance of the uncertainty and changeableness of worldly things than that of the burning of the city of Lions [Lyons] in France. From a great and flourishing city in the space of twelve hours was burnt down. And see Sewel's <title>History</title>, page 525, the City of London was turned into rubbish and ashes insomuch that after an incessant fire which lasted four days, but little of old London was left standing, there being about thirteen thousand and two hundred houses burnt. Thomas Briggs foretelling their destruction if they did not repent as Nineveh did<note type="editorial">Jonah 3:1-10</note> and does not the signs of the present times seem to threaten us with dissolation [desolation] after divers ways and divers manners: the alarm of war, famine, and pestilence. See Exodus 9th and 24th and see Genesis 19:24. What an account of a dreadful indignant and thee the account of Thomas's story of the terrible earthquake in portrayal in Jamaica in 1692, when a great part of the city was sunk and many hundreds and perhaps thousands perished in a few minutes by an earthquake. In the year 1665, one year before the fire in London, more than 4000 died in one week of the pestilence. See II Kings 19:35, the angel of the Lord slew one hundred and fourscore and five thousand in one night. In sacred and other histories a solemn night be collected of the dismal doings amongst the children of men which by obedience and true humility might easily be prevented, see Psalms 78 and 48 verse.</p></div>

Some lively exhortations but a sorrowful account that <persName key="w6t25v7b">Joseph Matlack</persName> has got down low in mind as ever. About the middle of Third Month 1812 I seen a letter at J.C. from Redstone giving an account of the earthquake very lately amongst them Ohio and the Western territories. So terrible that the brick and stone houses cracked and shook as if they would fall and caused them to scream and cry out in a dismal manner and marked their faces, it is said, with seriousness, sadness and gloominess in divers places. But these things wear off and seem soon forgotten, as it has been remarked after the plague in London. It is said things soon fell into their old channel, and as we have seen after the fever in Philadelphia, when several thousands were swept away in a few months, so that now after having been thus visited year after year, As soon as the storm is over things return to their old channel, so that very little marks or signs of amendment or reformation to be seen, although in the midst of these calamities many were much alarmed and many promises of amendment mad when the streets were left desolate. The people fled many houses, left desolate, great, and fair without inhabitant. But so we read it was the Children of Israel when delivered from Pharaoh and the Red Sea; they sang his praises but soon forgot his works.</p></div>

Some very good remarks were made to the deficiencies that appeared in our members by the answers by Wm. Flanner, Jesse Kersey, and several other Friends. Kersey observed that is parents were rightly concerned for themselves their souls being made alive in Truth that children would be benefited by observing that was the case with the father whose soul and that of his son would come to be bound in one and the same communion.</p>

And it was well observed by a wise man that none are good except such who are so inwardly and by themselves, and virtue is always the same – as cautious, as prudent upon the account of conscience as it is in obedience to the public laws and customs of the World; as fearful of offending one's own self and as careful to avoid condemnation of one's own breast when no eye sees us as it is of the observation and reproaches of all mankind. Page 479: there is one thing more fit to be observed on this occasion. A sad and wicked thing it is, viz. that Men, being depraved by a kind of hypocrisy natural to them, have taught themselves and others to make a greater conscience and be infinitely more scrupulous and concerned for their outward behavior, although the moderating our passions and the regulating our whole life and conversation depends upon a due attention to the dictates of conscience. And yet the former – that is, a greater concern to conform to the ways of this world – will degenerate into formality, of course, and by insensible degrees grow cold and negligent in regard to that of keeping a clear conscience.</p>

It is said the Christians formerly, when under their greatest suffering, they were most favored with divine power and the influence of Heavenly goodness. But from time to time when they were relieved from suffering and tried with peace and plenty they lost ground in religion, as we read Jesuran waxed fat and kicked.<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 32:15</note> The primitive Christians said that prosperity was a very intoxicating thing and few brains were strong enough to bear it, and is that not very evident so in many instances down to this day? Our first Friends suffered great persecution and great was the labor and concern of many of them in soliciting the rulers and powers of the earth for their release and enlargement, and at length when that was obtained, one of the most noted cried out, not all the persecutors, open apostates and enemies we have ever had in the world ever hath done as that hurt that prosperity has done. It appears prosperity hath ever proved the greatest and most fatal trial upon virtue. As one said, oh, prosperity, prosperity, what hast thou done? This was the charge formerly: when thou hast eaten and art full then beware lest thou forget the Lord [Deuteronomy 8:10-11], etc. Beware lest your hearts deceive you and ye be drawn aside after other gods, etc.,<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 11:16</note> said the prophet.</p></div>

As one observes, viz., Moses West, who writes well on the subject of marrying near kindred, says the loss of peace of mind is the greatest of all losses. So on the other hand the gaining or obtaining peace of mind or peace of conscience is the greatest of all blessings. If people did consider it to be so, how could they go to meetings in a state of ease and indifferency or lukewarmness when so great a treasure is at stake as peace of conscience? And the loss of it the greatest of all losses, which undoubtedly is so, and all find it to be so when he that rides the pale horse approaches. Very much tried with disappointments in getting help now in the midst of plowing time. I am informed that it is in newspapers an account of a very great fog in England, so that many people lost their lives and many horses. It was so thick and dark that carriages ran one against another and people got so lost and bewildered that they could not find their own doors. And also an account in the news of a very great frost in Carolina that destroyed their cotton and the seed of it, so that the loss was said to be irreparable. <persName key="w6n87x9b">Job Scott</persName> mention a frost in his journal, so it seems now as formerly, call after call, after divers ways and divers manners.

Very many have taken up a rest short of the true rest and so remain till it is too late. Then this hath been the cry of many, oh, for a little more time, though a whole age were too little for the work I have to do! Kept it to myself, what would a man give in exchange for his soul?

How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me?<note type="editorial">Judges 16:15</note> He that loves God serves him; he that does not, neither doth nor can serve him however great acts of outward devotion he may perform, said John Staupits, one of the first Reformers.

Many are very lively in worldly business who are very dull and drowsy in religion; if they were as lively in religion as they are in worldly affairs, there would be great room for hope. Turn to and read James Gough's Epistle, page 171 and 172: the state of some meetings in his days, poor lifeless meetings. Thus have some meetings died away and are lost, and others appear to be in a languid, sickly condition, seeming scarcely likely to live long unless they timely apply to the great and good physician, etc.</p></div>

John Baldin of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at our meeting House. People come pretty freely and plentifully, but, alas, their expectation were too much outward.

<p>First Day, 5 of the Sixth Month. <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs> and I went to Evesham meeting, very low and poor forepart, but grew better. <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName> and Priscilla Wells, a new beginner, both had something to say which seemed to help the meeting, and after them I had an open, favored, owning time, good satisfaction. Oh, how open, free, and near people seemed to be after meeting! I went to see William Austin, who had got very badly hurt helping move a barn. Several of them were weighing down on a large pry or hand spike, the rest jumped off suddenly and it flew up and tossed him up and he fell down and the pry fell on him broke his collarbone and several of his ribs and mashed his breast so that his life is much despaired of. He is sensible though in great misery. So true it is as one day goes, another comes and sometimes shews us dismal doom. He appears to have been an innocent, orderly man and seems resigned and willing to leave this world. Has a wife and good estate but no children to leave. He died soon after.</p>

<p>T. Bromley, <title>Journeys of the Children of Israel</title>, page 168: mystical idolatry, one species of which is the immoderate love of ourselves. 2 Timothy 3:2: or the letting out that fullness of affection to any creature which is only due to God, whom we are to love with our whole heart but nothing else, so by the reposing too much confidence in ourselves or in any other person or thing besides God – whether it be riches, honor, or wisdom etc. Little children, keep yourselves from idols,<note type="editorial">1 John 5:21</note> said the inspired penman. Then should we be safe enough from danger, if we kept this command: thou shalt have no other God before me. But, alas, how many are the idols and how doth idolatry greatly abound in the love of earthly things! In another place it is said, they shall all go into confusion together that are makers of idols<note type="editorial">Isaiah 45:16</note> and is this the cause why all nations it is said are now at wars and dismal confusion? The heresy of all heresies is an earthly, worldly mind, says <persName key="w6cv5qpd">William Law</persName>. If so, how much does it abound! The rumors of wars and clouds of confusion seem to increase and gather blackness, offering and tempting the young men with great wages and land if they get the victory, so they are enlisting by hundred and going off to the seat of war at Canada and the Lakes. Great turnings and overturnings and rumors of wars we hear in Europe.</p>

Micajah Collins of Lynn, near Salem in New England, was there and was large in testimony on the solemn subject of prayer, but, oh, the dullness and drowsiness that attended the people, many of them.

I thought there was something sweet, savory and owning forepart. Simon Gilum of Pennsylvania and Micajah Collins were sweetly exercised in their gifts, answering the queries. Life seemed to lower but growed better again and on the whole a pretty good satisfactory time, though I was over wearied and poorly weak and feeble. Heard of the death of <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> of London Grove Quarter, a very great and powerful minister. 'Tis said he and his daughter set off from home for Philadelphia in a chair, got but four or five miles and he fell down and died immediately. Thought to be an apoplectic fit.

Oh desirable, happy, and blessed experience! Oh, for the inward life, the hidden life, the life that's hid with Christ in God, as we read. See Psalms CVII, a most precious chapter. Again see Job V, chapter 20 verse: in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword; 21 thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh. Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth, for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace, and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin. Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth; 26 thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like a shock of corn cometh in his season.

Moses West says the loss of peace of mind is the greatest of all losses. So then the gaining or obtaining peace of mind is the greatest of all gains, more than all earthly treasures, joys, pleasures or delights. See William Dell's words page 88, Bound with T. Bromley: unbelief keeps a man in himself, but faith carries a man out to Christ. Now there is no man weaker than he that rests on himself and there is no man stronger than he that forsakes himself and rests on Christ.

David prayed to be upheld by the Lord's free spirit,<note type="editorial">Psalms 51:12</note> so we are helped along and upheld. Although the winter and abundance of wet, cloudy weather which was feared would hurt the harvest and its like. It did cause it to be very light in many places, yet we have more and better harvest than last year. I hear that a few weeks ago there was a very hard wind, thunder, and hail which tore down much timber, cut their Indian corn much, and beat down the rye a few miles above Ancocas meeting house. How many ways to be deprived of the fruits of the [word unclear, earth?].</p>

<dateline><date when="1814-07-10">10th of the Seventh Month, 1814.</date></dateline><p> First Day morning. See John Griffith's Journal, 420: The general consent of all ages and nations to that of the immortality of the soul and future rewards and punishments and although the professor of Christianity were favored with more clear apprehensions thereof than others, yet numbers of them live as if they had no such belief or as if they did not look upon themselves to be accountable creatures. This remark seemed to correspond with my own prospect and sight of great numbers and has been much on my mind in my contemplations and considerations of things. I have called, but ye have not answered; when you call, I will not answer but will laugh at your calamity and mock when your fear cometh.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 1:24-27</note> A dismal state beyond expression, vastly different from that of being favored of the Lord. Eye hath not seen nor ear heard what the Lord hath in store for his faithful children.<note type="editorial">1 Corinthians 2:9</note> When the Lord riseth up what shall I do, and when he calls what shall I answer him?<note type="editorial">Job 31:14</note> This is the cry of poor sinners who have lived as without God in the world: at last, what shall we do to be saved? What good thing shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? A savior or I die, a redeemer or I perish. So it is and so it has been. In their calamity they poured out a prayer, etc. Again, see John Griffith's journal, page 416: what a powerful efficacious thing Christianity was when it made its first entrance into the world! And so continued for a considerable time, mightily prevailing by its own force and efficacy against all opposition and worldly interest until the world smiled upon its professors. It then spread as to the name, but gradually losing the power and the life; many disorders, great corruptions, and desolating contentions about trifles got in, and this, I have oft considered of late, would be the case if religion is suffered to go to decay. The world would become like a wilderness, the spirits of people would become like the briars and thorns and filled with spirits like lions and bears and wolves and like hissing serpents and stinging scorpions. And like, as expressing scripture, like stubble fully dry, and then behold as the apostle says: what a great matter a little fire kindles.<note type="editorial">James 3:5</note> And as <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> says, when he was first sent out in the Lord's service to arouse and awaken the drowsy world, it was like a wilderness filled with devouring, voracious beast like lions, bears, wolves, etc., all ready to devour him and all the lambs and sheep of Christ, and many died in prisons and other ways under their cruelty and grievous oppression, more cruel than the beasts of the wilderness.</p>
    <note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Very dry weather; much show for rain but all goes off.</note>
<p>Went to our meeting. Unwell; numbness and pain in my head. Although not destitute of suitable thoughts, but great want of that that quickens and makes alive.

But too many are contented without witnessing the frequent renewings of divine love in which only there is life. If they are but preserved from gross evils and go on in prosperity they sit down easy and think all is well. But, Oh! that they may not too late find their mistakes and that they have pleased themselves with favors which they have unthankfully received and so stopped short of greater by not desiring them full of other guest like of old.

But alas, to view the state of mankind in general, how are their minds and time taken up about transitory and trifling things which amount to nothing and come to nothing, whilst eternal and immortal things are lamentably neglected to their irreparable (and it is to be feared) everlasting unspeakable loss. To think how much precious time is lost in unnecessary unprofitable thoughts and unprofitable conversation! As formerly we read many walked after things that did not profit and loved to wander as we see at this day. And what a pity it is that the mind should be thus trifling when it has so great and glorious a work to do. What a pity that one minute should be lost in unprofitable thoughts or conversation! The righteous that hold on their day do not do so. As <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> remarks on his and my cousin, <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName>, that he heard him say in public testimony that he was so given up to the service of his great master that he did not desire to spend one minute to please himself, and his conduct corresponding with it was animating or stimulating to him. If I be a father, where is my honor and if I be a master, where is my fear etc.?<note type="editorial">Malachi 1:6</note></p>
<p>Oh, says Thomas à Kempis, that I could spend one hour or half hour after the best manner, and <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says (I think) that he could hardly wish a man better than that he was in a way of making the best use of his. Another said at last that he repented of all his life long but that part which he spent in communion with God and doing good. Certainly this is the wisest way and the effect the most glorious at last. It is remarked by divers wise writers the last words of Grotius, on observing his assiduity or devotedness, etc., he cried out, alas I have spent a great part of my time in laborious doing of nothing. So it is to be feared many will find it who are almost if not altogether taken up with the cares and concern of this world. The summer over, harvest gone, and we are not gathered. Who can calculate the loss? Is there a possibility of avoiding this loss by any other way or means than by coming to a state of true resignation? Oh, said David, send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me and teach me,<note type="editorial">Psalm 43:3</note> and again we read as many as are led by the spirit of God are the Sons of God. Then what a pity we should be led by a wrong spirit in spending our time in unprofitable thoughts and conversation when on the one hand there is such unspeakable gain and on the other such great loss. Went to our meeting. An open, lively time although it held rather too long to please all. Very busily engaged getting hay. I seem forced to work too hard quite. See Matthew 6 and 26: the fowls of the air sow not nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly father feedeth them and <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> says, page 336: Nor do I believe infinite goodness and power for us in this life, etc.   Very excellent remark follow. See <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName>, page 329, and to strive for riches which frequently introduce oppression and bring forth wars and grievous calamities, and as Chilon says riches brings forth luxury and that tyranny and I think barbarity. grievously afflicting on another. My neighbor <persName key="w6vr3t5g">C. French</persName> was reading an account in the news of a dreadful malignant mortal disease in Mexico like a pestilence or kind of fever that twenty six thousands died in the space of about one summer.</p>
<p>See Amos IV: 10 chapter, I have sent among you the pestilence. How often has this been done in many ages and nations down to his day, and of latter times in our land, east and west, north and south hath a mortal fever swept away great numbers.</p>

<p>See Humphrey Smith's book, page 108, the love of God declared and Satan's wiles discovered, the effects of despising little things. But let such mark and observe themselves, for no more unto them is committed, neither do they grow or come any further but there stand as dry plants, coming long to meetings, having the form, but not feeling the power. For such who deny their obedience in anything to the light of Christ, he will deny them his power in all things. Thus many wiles and ways doth the enemy watch to devour. And see d<supplied>itt</supplied>o. page 114: They follow witchcraft who obey not the truth which makes free, whose seed, like Cain, whose seed loves that which keeps from the Lord and leads into the witchcraft (like Saul), not obeying the Lord nor his son.

<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Grows very dry weather.</note>
<p>Since the 21 I have been at our meeting divers times, but nothing material to remark except it is lowness, dryness, poverty, and formality. A state of ease and unconcernedness too prevalent, notwithstanding we have very fresh alarming accounts of dreadful destruction with the warlike people and it seems to come nearer and nearer home. The English lately landing an army of men and attempted to take the President at the federal city on Potomac River, Maryland. Did not take him, but burnt his house and divers others, to the loss of many thousands of dollars and the loss of many hundreds of lives, they say, and several hundred taken captive.</p>
<p>We hear that it is a pinching, trying time with the poor over in the western territories; grain scarce and provisions very dear, and so it seems to be here. Divers say they do not think the last harvest on the whole was more than half a crop and their distilleries destroy abundance of rye, all which makes it very scarce and dear – rye now dearer than wheat and very few. Eastward we hear of the scarcity of bread, but both bread and meat dearer here than I ever remember. Pork from 18 to 20 and upward per pound.</p>
<p><persName key="w6t25v7b">Joseph Matlack</persName>, of whom I remarked a few months back – see 9 of Ninth Month back – a few days ago hanged himself. He had got brave for some weeks past and got to work and stayed with his family, but they discovered that he was growing worse and more disordered again in his mind. Oh, the scenes of sorrow! He was an ingenious man. He had a very heavy spell of the fever when a boy, lay near a week almost like a corpse but got well and married very well, raised a family of fine children. His wife died, as I have remarked, a few years ago with a dismal cancer, and he seemed to bear his troubles exemplary. But now this was the end of him. After having appeared in the ministry several years acceptably and considerable growth, the beginning of his disorder in mind seemed to proceed from a small cut on his ankle, which from the symptoms seemed to threaten the lock-jaw, so that he became much alarmed and so to lose his reason.</p>

<p>The city of Philadelphia is said to be very healthy this fall, not visited with the pestilential fever, but are in great fear of being visited with the sword as Alexander and Washington federal cities lately have been with great destruction of houses and property – very great alarms and preparations for war. Heard of several very sudden deaths. One Born Hill in Philadelphia fell down in the street as he was going from Presbyterian meeting and died instantly; and a woman in Evesham, as well as usual in the evening and found and dead in her bed in the morning; and of an elderly man in the newspapers taken unwell at midnight, sent for the doctor, who, feeling his pulse, both of them died immediately in Orleans. People talk of these things, but how very little effect they have.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1814-09-08"><dateline><date when="1814-09-08">8th of the Ninth Month, 1814.</date></dateline><p> At our Monthly Meeting. A pretty, open, lively time. I came off without condemnation. <persName key="w6p37ppz">Enoch Roberts</persName> of Pennsylvania passed meeting with G. Frinch's daughter. This afternoon I heard that a man by the name of Hunter (of Trenton), a very noted lawyer, fell under lowness and discouragement of mind on account of his circumstance and debts, and, although it is said his father-in-law offered to pay his debts, he took up a resolution that he would never break his fast again and so persisted in his resolution and refused taking victuals sixteen days, they say, and then died. Two instances I remarked, some years ago, of the like: J. Hollinshead and J. Harvey, and two were a few years ago burnt to death drunk as they lay by the fire. One Finemore, an elderly man near Burlington, the other a young man but left a wife and several children but a few miles from Burlington. J. Harvey, the younger. See here the doleful effects of the want of true religion. But these are but a very few instances amongst thousands and millions innumerable. It is remarkable, of late we hear of sudden deaths every few days. A man in Evesham killed by his horses running away with his wagon and young woman drowned in Delaware River. The fireworks in the steam boat bursted and sunk the boat; the rest were relieved by a boat in sight. Although these sudden deaths demonstrate the necessity of being ready at a short warning or none at all, they seem to have but very little effect as to awakening people to a care, to prepare for them and seem only to serve for a piece of fresh news. Most but the drunkards and worldlings notice these accidents they are full</p>

Although I was very poorly, I set off to go to our meeting in hopes I should get better but I got but about half way and was forced to stop at a neighbor's house until <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and children came back from meeting. My complaint has been what some call the colere [cholera] morbus or severe lax and vomiting, so I remain very poorly with it several days. May we not, when we look back, conclude we are some of us as brands plucked out of the burning or as a bird escaped from the hands of the fowler when we consider the many snares temptations and dangers we have met with. Temptations (as <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty</persName> says in his diary) to the greatest of wickedness, temptations to drunkenness, whoredom, and worldly, earthly mindedness and all manner of wickedness, and now to behold the bewitched infatuated state of the poor drunkards who seem to have lost the power of delivering themselves. How they seem to be enchanted, how they saunter about the tavern stores and still houses where a dram is to be had. It seems out of their power to keep from these schools of Satan, and, oh, what sorrowful work it makes with the wives and children! Now this plentiful season for apples, even men of bright genus [genius] and extensive capacities and are the wretched worldlings in a much better state? A worldly spirit (says one) is the most unready for a dying hour.</p>

<p>See <title>Everyman's Monitor</title>, page 195: as security bolsters men up in their brutal sensuality, so sensuality rocks them asleep in their carnal security. And page 139: there is no way to avoid a national dissolution but by a national reformation. If this be true, how necessary for America to attend to it now, when we are so threatened with dissolution and is really fallen on divers places. Many houses left desolate, destroyed, great and fair without inhabitant, like the land of Median [Midian] and tents of Cushan. As the prophet said, he saw them in an afflicted trembling state,<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:7</note> and is it not so in divers places now in our land? And Oh, how outward are the minds of most thinking to bringing about a peace and reconciliation but by changing men and measures in civil society and never seem to look into themselves for the cause of the threatening dissolution, nor for the right way to bring about a recopilation which no doubt is by a national reformation like Nineveh, whose example was written for our instruction and can there possibly be any other safe way for us at this day?</p>

<p>A certain writer says (<title>Everyman's Monitor</title>, page 192), if there be a heaven upon earth it is in the company of Godly men. But I think it is in the company and communion with God and Christ. It is that only which can make a prison as pleasant as a palace and caused Paul and Silas to sing in the stocks. The meeting was large; it is wonderful to see the vast increase of numbers and of the advancement in outward conveniences – roads filled with carriages for miles together, and with what alacrity they seem to run and gather! But I was thinking whither <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> and many others of our first worthies who labored so greatly to propagate this principle we profess, traveling through this our land when it was a vast howling wilderness in danger of being (as tis said of being) devoured by the wild beast and at that time possessed what they professed – even the favor protection and blessing of preservation, the one thing needful – whither or no after all this great labor bestowed upon us and the vast outward increase and improvements, they could sit down easy with us and own us, and whither or no we in our present state after all do as they did, that is, possess what we profess and are building upon the same foundation the rock of ages against which the gates of hell never did or ever shall prevail.</p>
<p>See the words of Philip Doddridge, <title>Everyman's Monitor</title>, page 258: pressing and urging a home, family, religion, and care of children, without which it is to be feared your care of them in other respects will turn to very little account. For what is prosperity in life without the knowledge and fear and love of God? What but the poison of the soul, which swells and kills it? What but the means of making it more certainty, more deeply, more intolerably, more miserable when all its transient and empty amusements are passed away like a dream when one awaketh?

Samuel Scofield of Pennsylvania was there and said a little. The meeting very poor and very low, I thought. Very great alarms of war. The English landed an army nearer Baltimore, where they were met by the Americans and driven back to their vessels. Accounts differ respecting the number killed, but they say several hundred on each side. It caused great alarm in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, drawing out the militia and raising and listing and drafting men to prevent their coming to Philadelphia. Some, I hear, are gone to prison rather than go to war, some leave their wives and little children to go and some young friends' children of the fore rank in our society so that what some of late have told us has come to pass on some viz. that the prison doors would be opened and the foundations tried of many, etc. </p></div>

For he that does thus procures his own dishonor and, while he strives with great pains to lift his head above the crowd, discovers his nakedness and shame at the same time. Oh, says [Isaac] Watts, how prone I am to make idols of blessing bestowed upon me, either temporal or spiritual, and again Isidore says pride is as apt to grow upon our virtues as our vice; and he that grows better, let him beware lest he grow proud and vain glory, give him a greater overthrow than his former vices.

<p>See <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron's</persName> work, page 444, on the nature and necessity of public government, and though its rising to a just height is gradual and slow, a work of much time and great pains and prudence, yet the ruins and decays of it are frequently sudden and surprising, and the constitutions which took up ages to finish and build up are broken and thrown down in a moment. But can this be the case with a constitution of true Christians, founded on the true Christian religion, which exceeds all the laws and discipline that ever men could invent for their safety and happiness, both present and future?

<div type="entry" n="1814-12-18"><dateline><date when="1814-12-18">18.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting. <persName key="w67b4w4h">Joseph Justice</persName> had acceptable service and it ended pretty well; though silent as to me, yet not without matter. See Thomas Hartley's works bound with [Thomas] Bromley, page 8, on the subject of mistakes on religion setting forth the state of religion time past both in adversity and prosperity: that we may not grow remiss by our advantages and so become losers by that which was intended for our benefits.  Has not this been the case with religious professors as he there shews, that the purest ages and most highly favored with heavenly goodness were in the times of greatest persecution, and whenever they were favored and tried with wealth and prosperity they lost the life, power, and spirit of true religion? And see page 47 of Hartley's works, speaking of that high state of Christian perfection in which men of purified souls hold intimate communion with God through the fellowship of his Holy Spirit and so on sitting forth the greatness of that blessed high attainment. Of such high experience at last he quotes one Dr. More's words, who calls it a most joyous state of mind – a union with the divine celestial principle – a state of glorious liberty. An inhabitant of Heaven, he that is come hither, God hath taken him to be his own familiar friend, and though he speaks to others aloof of in outward religions and parable, yet he leads this man by the hand, speaks to him plainly in his own language, sweetly insinuates himself into and possesses all his faculties, understanding, reason, and memory. This is the darling of God and a prince amongst men, far above the dispensation of either miracles of prophecy.</p>
<p>Oh, how have many, many, very many, of us, indeed, been pursuing lying vanities and forsaking our own mercies, seeing we are endowed with capacities and gifts and means to attain to such a blessed and happy enjoyments here on earth! Again, see Hartley, page 67: it is very certain that the greatest part in every age and place have stopped short of the truth and substance by resting in the outside of things and therefore St. Paul, that great preacher of of inward and spiritual religion, takes much pains both with Jew and Gentile to convince them of their gross ignorance and error, etc., etc., in this particular.</p>
<p>And see page 59, where he ascribes or describes the operations of the spirit of God in Holy souls: at certain times they are elated as at a royal banquet and rejoice with gladness and joy unspeakable; at other times, as the angels light and agile and, as it were, free from all encumbrance of these material vehicles; and at other times, like men overcome with drink, exhilarated and even intoxicated with the spirit; at other season they are sunk into grief and lamentation for all mankind, interceding for the whole stock of Adam and taking up a wailing and weeping for it. Then again so inflamed with the joy and love of the spirit that, if it were possible, they would snatch up every man into their bosom. Sometimes they are humbled so far below every other person in self abasement that they think themselves inferior to and less than all; at others they resemble a strong man who comes forth in royal armour to the battle and valiantly overcomes his enemies, etc. So very various is the ways of the spirit in conducting the soul to God – sometimes refreshing her and sometimes trying and exercising her, that so she may be presented pure and perfect to our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>I have thought I have felt these ups and downs – as David says, by thee have I run through a troop, etc.<note type="editorial">Psalm 18:29</note> – and at other times feel as if I could not go at all any further. At some times feel, as <persName key="w6nk4g54">Thomas Scattergood</persName> said, as if I could run from one end of the continent to the other, etc.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1815-01-22"><dateline><date when="1815-01-22">22 of the First Month.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting. It seemed like low water and hard getting along, yet came off middling, though not that life and savor as some other times. It was a most violent snowy, stormy day, the largest snow of any yet this winter. Wind very high and snowed so fast it looked dismal. Could see but a little ways through it. I was afraid some would perish in this storm.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Clear up moderate.</note>
<p>I have read first volume of [Thomas] Clarkson's writings on the abolition of the slave trade containing 455 pages, in about four days, and it was very affecting to see the accounts of the grievous sufferings and destruction and misery of the many thousands of the poor black people and also the grievous destruction and misery of great numbers of seamen in bringing them from Africa. From the year 1640 to the year 1787, I think, <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> and <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName>, page 314 and 318, says one hundred thousand yearly has been brought away. And then to see and think how the lord raised up instruments in every nation and amongst almost every religious society of people and their great and united labor to put a stop to this most grievous, wicked traffic in slaves and what great opposition they met with and how they were carried through all until they obtained their end, the abolition of the slave trade, an evil of the deepest dye amongst mankind and of long continuance. It might serve to shew what great things may be done in bringing about a reformation and removing the greatest of evils and long and deep rooted vain customs, when and where men are faithful and united. Then, as we read, they might say to this mountain, be thou plucked up and planted in the sea and it should obey you.</p>
<p>See <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox's</persName> <title>Journal</title>, page 309: therefore let none murmur nor distrust God, for he will provoke many to zeal against unrighteousness and for righteousness, through things that are now suffered to work for a season. Yea, many whose zeal have been dead shall revive again and they shall see their backslidings and bewail them bitterly; for God shall thunder from heaven and break forth in a mighty noise. His enemies shall be astonished, the workers of iniquity, confounded; and all that have not on the garment of righteousness shall be amazed at the mighty and strange work of the Lord, which shall certainly be brought to pass. The Lord will provoke many to zeal against unrighteousness, etc. See, hath it not been so from the beginning, ever since the days of Noah, who was a preacher of righteousness? And David said, the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.<note type="editorial">Psalm 69:9</note> And Phinehas – zeal, as we read, was accounted unto him for righteousness when he slew them caught in adultery.<note type="editorial">Psalm 106:29-31</note> And Cyrus, whom the Lord calls his shepherd, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations<note type="editorial">Isaiah 45:1</note> and so down to these days. Many, many, many, indeed, have been raised up with great zeal against unrighteousness, as many be seen in the accounts of the progressive steps. Oh, the great work of the reformation in divers ages and nations! As John Wycliffe, who was called the morning star of the reformation, <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName>, and great numbers of others too tedious to mention – some for one part of the business and some for another. Thomas Clarkson and many others to labor for the melioration of the poor, grievously injured, suffering Africans; John Howard  for the poor sufferers in nasty prisons. Oh, how zealous they were in their labors giving up all time and talent, and hazarding their lives in their labors through great perils and dangers – as Paul says, perils by land, perils by sea, and in the wilderness, and above all amongst false brethren<note type="editorial">2 Corinthians 11:26</note> – but were preserved through all by the Lords preserving power, who fitted, qualified, and raised them up for his service!

It seemed dangerous to be out and to me; it looked awful to see how the creatures trembled with the cold and how they shrinked up. And how many of the poor must suffer, who have but poor cold houses scant of provision and of victuals and clothes, by night and by day and pinched very much for firewood. Oh, how many poor women must suffer (and their children) who have drunken, careless, lazy husband! And it's likely many of the rabbits, squirrels and partridges and, etc., will perish, as I suppose they often do in such hard weather. I have been told that the Indians used formerly to say when they had such hard cold winters they thought the Great Spirit was angry with them. So it seem clear they believed there was an all powerful being that superintended the universe and presided over the seasons of heat and of cold and of plenty and of scarcity of health and of sickness, etc.</p>

Left a wife and family of children. Last Fifth Day, very cold, he was at our preparative meeting and was our clerk. We had an unusual deal of business respecting our schools, appointing committees to attend them, care of meeting house lots, funds about building more stables or sheds, etc., etc. Several of us thought we never seen him act more lively and with more propriety. He was taken with a chill latter part of the meeting. He got home and his illness increased so rapidly that he seemed not sensible till he died, which was about three days. Illness with what the doctors call a typhus fever or typhus quinsy. Divers others have been suddenly taken away in like manner, suddenly deprived of their reason. I had some satisfaction at the house, although the solemn call seemed to make too little impressions on the minds of the people. <persName key="w67b4w4h">Joseph Justice</persName> there.</p>
<p>Fifth Day. Found one of our horses dead this morning. It has been ailing and lingering several months and pretty old. It prevented my getting [to] meeting. Also at this time, we heard of the death of Caleb Crispin of Evesham, about fifty. He has been in a lingering poorly way a considerable time past, although a stout man a few years ago. So we see it is as formerly; one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet; another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure tedious days and wearisome nights appointed unto them, as Job says.<note type="editorial">Job 7:3</note></p>
<p>First Day. At our meeting. Something owning to good satisfaction and strengthening.</p>
<p>Second Day. Went on business to our son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName>. Heard of the death of Esther Troth, about 76 perhaps, and that she was burnt to death. Fell into the fire and there burned till they discovered a very unusual smell. She once lived in the family where I was an apprentice. It is appointed for all once to die, but the time when, the place where and the manner how is a secret. But one way to come into the world but many ways to go out of it. We come into the world naked and bare, go through it with trouble and care, go out of it nobody knows where, but if we do well here, farewell there.<note type="editorial">“We came into the world…” attributed to John Edwin (1749-1790)</note></p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1815-02-09"><dateline><date when="1815-02-09">9th of the Second Month, 1815.</date></dateline><p> At our Monthly Meeting. I think our Monthly Meetings are mostly favored and lively, though yet room for great improvement in solidity and weightiness.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-02-10"><dateline><date when="1815-02-10">10.</date></dateline><p> I went to our neighbor <persName key="w6vr3t5g">C. Frinch's</persName> to mend his pump. The children read some account in the news that the typhus fever prevails to an alarming degree in the District of Columbia, and from the Portsmouth papers, N.H. Oracle of December 31, this typhus or spotted fever rages greatly. They say those who are most liable to it are those who fatigue themselves by too frequent, and assiduous watching with the sick, the intemperate or drunkards, and who violently expose themselves or exert themselves carelessly to the weather, the young and infirm females who go too thinly clothed and (wear as that doctor expresses himself) wear cobweb shoes and stockings. In an account some time or years back, the doctors say this sickness fell very much on the young women, owing to their going in such thin dresses, their silks and their arms bare almost up to their shoulders. This typhus, epidemical malignant fever, attacks them in various ways but makes a rapid progress and takes them away they say sometimes in three, six, nine or twelve hours. Richmond, Virginia also inform that this contagious distemper rages there; (they say) the distemper is distressing beyond anything that you can imagine. It takes of whole families; the nearest relations are afraid to go to see one another. If the disease does not abate I am apprehensive it will destroy the greatest part of our inhabitants.</p>
<p>In King George, there was a family of ten, the whole dead except a little boy, who went to a neighbor's house after starving a day or two and asked for some bread. The neighbor asked him if he had not a plenty of bread at home. He said his father and mother and the rest of the family were asleep and that he could not wake them. He was asked how long they had been asleep. He said a day or two. The neighbors went over and found nine of them dead. They were so much alarmed they concluded to set fire to the house and burn them up, which was done. The coffin maker has made thirteen coffins in eight or ten days. This alarming disease has raged in divers places and made great ravages or destruction – it frequently kills in from six to twelve hours (and some say in three hours instances have been known). It principally preys upon the heartiest and most robust patients. The physicians are at a loss to describe or treat it; some describe it as a typhus fever, others as a violent, inflammatory sore throat. It affects the throat most violently and obstructs the circulation of the air through the windpipe.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Our neighbor <persName key="w63p2txf">Joshua Robert</persName>, his throat was very much affected, and several others who have died near Moorestown.</note>
<p>In a few instances, as in the one above stated, the houses in which the dead have laid have been burnt down to prevent the diffusion of the contagion. They say six burials met together at one time in one graveyard.</p>
<p>In some in some instances whole families are destroyed, see my account in 1812, 7 of the Sixth Month in New England. They are frequently struck with a perfect lethargy and loss of senses, sometimes only with acute local pain. But in most cases, the process of death, however the patient is assailed, is tremendously rapid and has prevailed in an alarming degree in Virginia. The Fall <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers</persName> and I went to Ohio; they died so that, they said, that their graveyard looked like a new plowed field and that there was not enough in health to nurse the sick or bury the dead, and were forced to stop travelers to help them. Not able to hand one another a cup of drink, not able to get in their harvest or put in their seed corn. Offered a dollar a night to one to help take care of them, and horses, plow, and seed corn to anyone that would put in their grain to the halves.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1815-02-12"><dateline><date when="1815-02-12">12th of the Second Month, 1815.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting. Rather smaller than common, and that not the worst of it. Very poor and low and quite silent, but I was fully of the mind that I missed it in being too backward afraid of myself when meeting broke up and came away in debt to some, and it cannot ever be recalled that I can see, for it's not likely I shall ever have the like opportunity with the same company together, or the like opening.</p>
<p>We had had several weeks of very cold, severe, freezing weather and much snow. No rain several weeks.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-02-16"><dateline><date when="1815-02-16">16.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting. <persName key="w6k6603s">David Roberts</persName> and our cousin <persName key="w6k08k1m">Rachel Hunt</persName> were married; an open, favored, strengthening time.</p>
<p>About this time a very great noise about + on account of peace being proclaimed, illuminating houses, villages and towns. Great indeed, was the folly of the people running into great excess, driving away to Philadelphia to see the illumination and rejoicing – the very children crying out in their beds, peace and plenty, etc., repeating it.</p>
<p>But I fear the rejoicing of many of them will be very short. 24 of the Sixth Month, 1812, I remarked that our rulers proclaimed war with England and marched off 1500 thousand [six] men to New York. A few years ago it was said that all nations were at war that we have any account of, and now in Europe all (it is said) have made peace after abundance of bloodshed and many died with hardships and sickness. Very lately, it is said, a dreadful battle at Orleans or Luseann [Louisiana] and several thousands slain and many taken prisoners.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-02-19"><dateline><date when="1815-02-19">19.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting which at first I thought very poor, low, and trying, but it growed better and ended pretty lively, as J.C. seemed to think. A great want of individual labor, but few to work brings the labor hard on a few. See <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox's</persName> <title>Journal</title>, page 638: for talking of victuals and clothes doth not clothe the body nor feed it. No more are their souls and spirits fed and clothed except they have the bread and water of life to feed them and the righteousness of Christ to clothe them. Talking of outward things and spiritual things and not possessing them may starve both their bodies and their souls. Therefore quench not the spirit of God which will lead to be diligent in all things. See page d<supplied>itt</supplied>o 641. I have lately printed the life of William Caton but have not made a collection of his books.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-02-23"><dateline><date when="1815-02-23">23 of the Second Month, 1815.</date></dateline><p> We went to the burial of our little granddaughter Martha Hunt, our son <persName key="w64v7902">Benjamin's</persName> daughter, about six years and eight months old. Lay ill about three weeks and suffered very much with a violent fever, sore throat and, they say, a dropsy in the head. A very cold and dreadful snowy day. Many are afflicted now a days with disorders, the doctors hardly know what to call them or how to treat them. Some, they say, after laying ill several weeks have recovered and lost their hearing and their senses. Oh, how many awful calls to be in readiness and how little effect they have! Death at distance we but slightly fear; he brings his terror as he draws more near, except it be to them who are prepared. These have had to that: death is not the king of terrors to them. Humphrey Smith said, just at last it is a fine thing for a man to have the Lord for his friend at last; to have the answer of <title>well done, good and faithful servant</title> at last is the crown of all and the greatest blessing ever conferred on man. What is it that constitutes the highest enjoyment of man on Earth, the highest source of happiness? See [J.P. Brissot de Warville's]<title> A Critical Examination of the Marquis De Chatelleux</title>, page 32. What is that which <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says is the supreme act of man's life? Is it not spiritual worship? What is it our Friends in a late epistle calls the supreme excellency of the Christian religion? Why, an acquaintance and communion with our maker, and Seneca, I think, says this is the highest pitch of Christian perfection. Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any hear and will open unto me I will come in and sup with him and he with me.<note type="editorial">Revelation 3:20</note> Is not this the highest honor and greatest riches? Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord.<note type="editorial">Isaiah 58:14</note> As <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> says a joy and delight of all others the most pure.

Joshua Austin and Priscilla Dudley were married, and old Rebeckah Lippincott, near 81, was buried before meeting. I was too late getting there, which hurt me (weather cold, bad roads) through diffidence and fear. I fear I was not clear of all there; after meeting it seemed so to me, and so one misstep makes way for another, as it did formerly with the Israelites – when they should have went to battle they would not, and when they should not go to battle, then they would go and so were defeated. Some thought it a favored time, but it was a mortifying time to me (and wounding). So, as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, always in danger of shot. Oh, the need of continual watchfulness, humility, and that fear which keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life and preserves from the snares of death. See [Robert] Barclay's <title>Apology</title>, page 3, seeing the height of all happiness is placed in the true knowledge of God (this is life eternal, to know the only true God and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent), the true and right understanding of this foundation and ground of knowledge in that which is most necessary to be known and believed in the first place. And see [Robert] Barclay's <title>Apology</title>, page 58: the horrible bloodshed about religion where with Europe hath been afflicted, and see same book, page 528: Friends' cruel abuse for using the plain language.</p></div>

See Thomas à Kempis' words, page 48: there is no true liberty, nor right gladness but in the fear of God and a good conscience. An excellent chapter, XVI, of compunction of heart. Very much snow has lain now about five weeks, frequent violent storms and severe cold freezing weather. The river so frozen up that they hall [hauled] wood over on the ice. Now a little more moderate.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-02-28"><dateline><date when="1815-02-28">28.</date></dateline><p> The last of the Second Month.

John Heald and his companion from Ohio were there, and there is a large number of choice Friends belonging to that quarter.</p>
<p>We have had about six weeks very severe winter freezing weather and very much snow. They have slid wood over the river on the ice several week together, but 1 of the Third Month grow warm and spring like, though the snow not quite gone.</p>
<p>Fifth day of Third Month. My daughter <persName key="w6136j8n">Hannah</persName> and I went to Evesham Preparative meeting. Forepart some satisfaction; some seemed glad to see me and hear me, too, though I thought the waters very low. Especially afternoon, great weakness appeared in answering queries.

<div type="entry" n="1815-03-03"><dateline><date when="1815-03-03">3.</date></dateline><p> At our select meeting better than common as to smooth getting along.

Received a remarkable account in a little book<note type="editorial">Frederick Smith, An account of a religious society in Norway, called Saints: with a few letters written by some of them. |c Also, some interesting particulars relating to several prisoners on board a Danish ship, who were convinced of the principles of Friends, from the year 1812 to 1814. London, Printed and sold by Darton and Harvey, 1814.</note> of the spreading of truth in Norway, convinced of Friends' principles by the medium of immediate revelation and of the propriety and necessity of silent worship by divine inspiration in an uncommon manner. Although wars hath prevailed and dreadful wickedness, yet there seem something like light breaking forth in many places and a great stir and inquiry amongst the people.</p>

E.R. and J.R. appeared very warm, swept away the great snow – extreme great and sudden changes of weather. A few days ago it was so freezing cold that it froze icicles to end of the horses' noses, and now so warm they sweat to a froth. Pamphlets now came out giving accounts of the dreadful destruction by the wars in Germany the like I never heard of in our days. Burning houses, town, and villages, destruction by sword, famine and pestilence all abound there. Dreadful scarcity of bread, thousands and thousands of families burnt out of house and home, thousands of children left helpless, fatherless and motherless, almost naked and exposed to very cold winter weather. Many thousands of pounds sent from England for the relief of these sufferers. Committees, both of men and women of the highest rank in life, appointed both in England and Germany to take care of the poor, especially the vast numbers of poor children, and great charity, benevolence and extensive care taken.</p></div>

Thomas tells me that the fever and great sickness prevails to an alarming degree in Carolina and parts of Virginia: whole families almost taken away in some instances.

<div type="entry" n="1815-03-23"><dateline><date when="1815-03-23">23.</date></dateline><p> At our preparative meeting, where was a marriage: John Matlack and Ann Lippincott. Came off middling well satisfied, yet great want of that ancient dew of Hermon [Psalm 133:3]. Much straitened to get another horse; went to several vendues to try to get suited. Oh, to see the faces of many poor captives to strong drink! With divers of this sort I have lately had some lively, pertinent opportunities. Unexpectedly, they themselves opened the way for it, as if they wanted to talk with me about this – their great weakness and failing. Some were tendered even to tears, expressing a fear that they were lost in an affecting manner. A few weeks ago, I was at a neighbor's house who made no profession of religion of any sort, though very industrious outwardly and frugal and orderly. It came into to my mind to say, you want but one thing more to make you as happy as it is possible for people to be on earth. What is that? said the woman. More religion, more goodness, I suppose – from whence a lively discourse proceeded to edification, I hope, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>About this time we hear of three or four most sorrowful accounts of young men taking to excess in drinking and several of the first rate families amongst Friends breaking up, making vendues after their parents had been at great expense buying farms and selling them. Grievous, grievous, heart piercing troubles indeed.</p></div>

Came off without condemnation, although not that sweetness, savor and life as last First Day. It is but rarely I have a downright good, satisfactory meeting. I now hear of seven people being drowned in the river against Cenemencen [Cinnaminson?]. The packet boat overset, fourteen passengers in it and seven lost. It is said the captain was in drink.

<div type="entry" n="1815-03-30"><dateline><date when="1815-03-30">30.</date></dateline><p> Some discourse with poor drunkards. I happened to be at the house of one who came home very much disordered with drink. I asked him what he thought would become of him if he went on so. I don't know, said he, I am afraid I shall go to hell. I told him he might be sure of it if he went on so. He died very suddenly sometime after. Another, under great remorse of conscience, lamenting his sorrowful condition, called rum, blass [indecipherable] nation, stuff, put his hand to his breast and said, here is enough, God condemns me and he died in the midst of his days in a miserable manner. They were men of estates. Another, after some discourse, said with a low voice, I am lost, I am lost. Looking up another poor old Indian, I asked him what he thought would become of him if he went on getting drunk. He said, I don't know, I suppose I must bear it. I told him he had better leave off and then he would not have to bear it. He answered no. So we may see that all believe in the doctrine of immortality, however inconsistent their conduct may be with such a belief. Another poor drunkard said just at last (greatly alarmed) he would sooner suffer his mouth to be sewed up than ever suffer another drop of rum to come in his mouth. But, alas, I might fill a volume of these sorrowful accounts. G.E. of Evesham.</p>

Heard of the death of a young woman – Bulah Hollen, about 25, died with the consumption at Moorestown – and of a young man at Moorestown, about 25. He has been poorly, several months in a declining state, but at last, they say, a gathering came on his throat and choked him to death. See the solemn calls to all sorts – these were of poor families. Another, in the midst of his days, had a great estate, a valuable choice wife and large family of fine children. [He] destroyed himself with drinking to excess. I went to see him and got there just after he was dead, and they told me he cried out just at last, why did you not keep strong drink from me? His wife answered, my dear, thee knows we could not.</p>

Going out in a boat in a party of pleasuring a sailing in, a violent squall of wind and heavy thundershower overset the boat. Oh, to see the frequent solemn calls and warnings and how little effect they have! I believe I could mention twenty instances of young people being drowned on the First Day, going out in parties of pleasuring, skating, swimming, skeeting, sledding, sailing, sleighing, etc., and divers of them Friends' children, whilst their parents were at meeting.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1815-04-09"><dateline><date when="1815-04-09">9 of the Fourth Month, 1815.</date></dateline><p> Was First Day. <rs key="w6wx87x7">My wife</rs> and I and daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> went to Westfield meeting. I thought there were signs of its being a time of general satisfaction, very kind, free, open and pleasant. After meeting, dined at our dear friend <persName key="w6jx3293">Thomas Lippincott's</persName>, who has lately returned from a journey of six or seven months with Micajah Collins of New England. They were at Ohio Yearly Meeting and there away and in Carolina and Virginia were at our cousin <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan Hunt's</persName> and gave comfortable accounts, etc. After meeting, Thomas and I visited Isaac Burrough's to satisfaction about his paying a fine.</p>
<p>This morning, I heard of the death of our dear friend Priscilla Wills, who I visited a few days ago. She has of latter time appeared acceptable in the ministry. I and <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and daughter were just setting off to Westfield, I being pre-engaged. I am informed that <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> was at her burial and had very acceptable service both at the house and at the meeting. This day I picked up two small books. One was an excellent account of Barnaby Nixon of Carolina.,<note type="editorial">Barnaby Nixon, Extracts from the manuscript writing of Barnaby Nixon, deceased. Richmond : J. Warrock, printer, 1814.</note> He died with a cancer in his eye. A worthy minister, many lively Instructing remarks there is in it. See page 32: on my way home (from a quarterly meeting) observing a house much shattered with the thunder (while I was gone) I stopped to inquire whether any lives were lost. I was informed that a number of people were in the house – one was much burnt with the lightning, but no one killed. These things are very awful, but he whose mind is stayed on the Lord is kept in perfect peace, page 32. The other was a small book giving a wonderful account of the life of John Newton<note type="editorial">Richard Cecil, Memoirs of the Rev. John Newton, late rector of the united parishes of St. Mary Woolnoth, and St. Mary Woolchurch Haw, Lombard Street; with general remarks on his life, connexions, and character. New-York : Thomas A.

See page 213: I have read of many wicked popes, but the worst pope I ever met with is pope self; and see page 242: John Newton used to say that if any one criterion could be given of a real work of grace begun in the heart of a sinner, it would be found in the contrite spirit. We read: a broken heart and a contrite spirit the Lord will not despise. But alas, how seldom found now in our days, whilst outward blessings are showered down in a very bountiful manner! Is it so, the fruitfulness of the earth causes barrenness in the minds of the people? Indeed, they that have most of it seem most dull, poor, and barren in religion or heavenly treasure. Thus, as we read, there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing<note type="editorial">Proverbs 13:7</note> etc.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-04-13"><dateline><date when="1815-04-13">13.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting. Very dull and very poor. Which state is to be preferred to be deprived of our religious liberty by cruel, hard hearted persecutors of or to be cheated out of the benefit of them by an easeful, lukewarm state of mind? John Griffith remarks that Christianity made its entrance into the world through all opposition and flourished till wealth and prosperity increased among them, and then they increased much in outward form and ceremony but lost the life and power. I now hear of a young man drowning himself. It is said a company went out a sailing in a party of pleasuring and he jumped of the boat with all his might. And of another dismal account, a young woman murdered and found dead in the road near J. Hain's ferry, either shot or stabbed in the breast. We hear of dreadful confusion at our river, quarreling about their fishing place so as to shooting one another near unto death.

<p>See Newton, page 204: a man is not taught any thing to purpose till God becomes his teacher, and then the glare of the world is put out and the value of the soul rises in full view, etc. Again see d<supplied>itt</supplied>o, page 201: there are critical times of danger after great services, honor, and consolations; we should stand upon our guard. Noah, Lot, Solomon, David, fell in these circumstances. Satan is a footpad; a footpad will not attack a man in going to the bank but in returning with his pocket full of money. And so indeed I have often found it and have often been robbed. Blessed is the man that is found watching at wisdom's gate, waiting at the posts of her doors. Mordecai and Daniel, we read, did so. That is, we read they sat at the king's gate.<note type="editorial">Esther 2:19, Daniel 2:49</note></p>

<p>Seventh Day afternoon I went to the burial of Elizabeth Matlack, wife of Jeremiah Matlack, near eighty years old. Has lain in a declining, weak state four years and five months, mostly confined to her bed. So we see it is tedious days and wearisome nights are appointed unto some, as Job of old said<note type="editorial">Job 7:3</note>; others die in their full strength in the midst of days. Death is certain to all, but the time when the manner how is a secret. But happy are they who in time wisely prepare for it. This is the one thing needful above all things to be concerned about on all occasions. Had some satisfaction at the conclusion.</p>

A more open time and lively zeal I seldom if ever seen on the subject, and poor little me was again, once more, owned amongst them in the exercise that prevailed and in a distinguished manner owned. Many friends with whom I had contracted some acquaintance in Pennsylvania, traveling amongst them, seemed very glad to see me and shewed a great deal of love and respect, divers telling me they thought I had been dead, I having been missing from Yearly Meeting six or several years, having steadily attended that meeting forty years or more. It was quite affecting to see and feel the love and respect they seemed to show for me. We stayed till 4 days and then came home, both of us being very poorly. I was not able to bear the closeness of the city and long sittings and vastly large meetings. It is said the house holds about two thousand people and full crowded every sitting. We got up to our meeting on Fifth Day, though small and dull with some, yet some lively zeal appeared in others. Came off middling well satisfied. Heard of the death of our worthy Friend Anna Mifflin and some think she died with a broken heart. One son went crazy and the other – worse – into the wars, which some thought shortened her days. These were the sons of that worthy elder <persName key="w6cz4d1t">Warner Mifflin</persName>. Heard that the malignant fever rages in places in Pennsylvania and Virginia. Our dear cousin, <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan Hunt</persName>, was at this Yearly Meeting and a very large number of very great able ministers were there from different parts. A friend was reading an account in the news of a most dreadful burning mountain that burst out lately with, as it were, vomiting a river of fire so that it destroyed five towns and quickly destroyed a vast number of people, showers of red-hot stone falling as thick as hail, and the people that escaped with life were left in the most distressed state of wretchedness, poverty and want of the necessaries of life, equal to the destruction of Sodom.</p>

Our cousin <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan</persName> returned to Philadelphia. Our folks say I mostly bring a new book home with me and I suppose it frequently is so. At cousin Henry Warrington's I picked up a new book, <title>The Life and Religious Experience of Mary Alexander of Old England</title>. Very lively, deep and savory are many of the accounts of her deep baptisms and also great experience of heavenly goodness. See page 105: I underwent the deepest baptism I ever experienced. Then again, presently, same page: it was a night which I desire may ever remain in my remembrance with reverent thankfulness to the blessed author of all good. I thought to feel what I then felt uninterruptedly would without augmentation constitute a joyful eternity. In the latter part are memorials concerning several ministering Friends and others deceased. Divers of them I have seen and heard very precious animating accounts. See page 111, of Thomas Comstock, who was traveling, visiting meeting when it was newly settled: they say we often beheld in him a dignified example of solemn silence.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> A silent standard bearer is as acceptable to the Lord as a loud speaking one</note>
<p>A great difference between that and an easy, trifling, sleepy, lukewarm, wandering mind. Again, see account of Mary Alexander, page 138, her sense of the state of a man declining in religion, fearing he was looking to be made perfect in the flesh: the word preached did not appear to have much entrance into the hearts of some, but blessed be the name of him whom I desire to serve. Not the fruits of our doings but the faithfulness of our hearts commends his dedicated servants to his divine acceptance.</p></div>

Again, see same book, page 17, of M. A. Shurman: at last expressed a desire to lay down all the glory she had acquired by means of her great acquirements, that so she might attain the favor of God as her principle treasure and cause of rejoicing. There are two sorts of treasures, delights, joys, and pleasures. The one is short and transitory; the other is permanent, unspeakable, and durable (see Alexander Arscott's writing page 103) and in the experience of it consists the highest evidence of the Christian religion. Oh, what wisdom it would be to set our hearts and minds on treasures, joys, and pleasures that are permanent and durable etc. Again, see page A. Arscott's 96: for what greater pleasure can there be conceived than that which a virtuous, pious soul enjoys when in its faithful walking in obedience to God it finds its peace to flow and the light of his countenance to shine upon it, by which those who are enjoyers of it are sensible of more real comfort at heart than when their corn and wine increase or any other external thing increased and much more so than in counterfeit pleasure, treasure in vicious courses.</p>

See page 541. I think it appears to me that what is wrote in that page – that people worship that which they love best and what their hearts minds and affections and desires are placed upon, whether it be the most desirable deserving object or something else. As we read, they worshiped the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made,<note type="editorial">Isaiah 2:8</note> and as John Staupitz<note type="editorial">Johann von Staupitz, 1460-1524</note> one of the first reformers, said: he that loves God, serves him.

After having labored very much, they say some few years before he died a very close trial befell him in his own family, which much affected his spirits. And though friends were very tenderly concerned for him, and that he might be preserved in his service as before, yet his weakness rather increased till his health became very much impaired and his understanding weakened, so that we suffered the loss of him in our meetings some time before his death, of which we were very sensible. Yet friends were satisfied he ended well, aged 69, a minister forty years. Oh, to think of the troubles and trials that attend the best of men and women! Many are the troubles even of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them out of them all. Our worthy friend Ann Mifflin died a few months ago and some think the conduct of her children shortened her days. Ye have made me to stink amongst the inhabitants of the Land, among the Canaanites and Perizezites, said good old Jacob<note type="editorial">Genesis 44:31</note> and what was the language of Rebecah if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, etc..<note type="editorial">Genesis 27:46</note> Bring down their grey hairs with sorrow to the grave . No doubt many have died of mere grief and trouble with a broken heart.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Whilst man in this imperfect state of being is confined, what pains assail this outward frame, what sorrow vex his mind.</note>
<p>The apostle said he had no greater joy than to see his children walk in the truth,<note type="editorial">3 John 1:4</note> and on the other hand is there any greater sorrow than to see the walk in the broad way that leads to destruction? Oh, how many serious calls to a devout and holy life! A few days ago, a young woman, by a fall from a window on a piece of timber, hurt her back so that she has no use of her limbs below the heart nor ever like to have since that. T. Balinger's son had his wagon run over him loaded with wood. Our neighbor Thomas Bispham, with several other families, got all ready to set off to Miami – 600 miles – is taken very ill. In these times of trouble, conscience has room to plead. But whilst in health many are so full of worldly concerns that the council of best wisdom is too little thought of or attended to. Yet how doth the things of this world and the concerns of it sink into an equal nothingness when death and eternity appears in full view! Then, as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, the cry is a world of gold and of pearl for a little more time! When they have been giving up all their time and talents for a little of this uncertain World. I forgot to note: last Fifth Day at our preparative meeting forepart some life, though many very drowsy. Money matter heard at last.</p>

I thought on the whole a much life and savor as is common amongst us, but, oh, how little of that to what we might experience if we were truly faithful and in earnest! Yet I wonder there was as much as there was, considering the lukewarmness and indifferency, love of this world and ingratitude.</p>
<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting. Silent as to myself, though not the poorest to me.</p>
<p>Sixth Day. At our select meeting very low and poor, dry and dull forepart, but ended lively, though rather mortifying than satisfactory to me. They cannot bear my rubbing and I doubt I don't do it so smooth and well as I ought to do.</p>

<p>Seventh Day I was catched  out in a soaking shower (on the place) at which time there was some pretty hard thunder as we stood under an apple tree, and I am told a pair of oxen killed with the thunder a few miles of, at near Cropwell on Joseph Evan's place.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-06-04"><dateline><date when="1815-06-04">4 of the Sixth Month.</date></dateline><p> First Day. We went to Cropwell Meeting. Came off pretty well, I hope and believe to general satisfaction. Heard of the death of Thomas Warrington, son of Abraham, a very stout, tall, healthy, young man who was here about amongst his relation last winter from Ohio, where it is said the malignant fever now much prevails, and of the deaths of several others natives of our parts.</p></div>

We – that is, <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and daughter <persName key="w6136j8n">Hannah</persName> – went to Haddonfield meeting. Very large, full, crowded. Our cousin, <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan Hunt</persName>, was there, whose testimony was very extensive and lively. We stayed their afternoon meeting, which was large and lively.

Our cousin had extensive service at last.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-06-14"><dateline><date when="1815-06-14">14.</date></dateline><p> Was our select quarterly meeting at Evesham. N[athan]. Hunt and <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> and John Shoemaker had very extraordinary, close, searching service, the like, I thought, I scarcely ever heard and I have often thought of late very much needed, for I think the children and them like lookers-on may see the dryness, dullness, formality, and indifferency amongst many of the fore rank amongst us, although in temporal interest lively enough. I lodged with those dear worthy friends at <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers's</persName>, and most sweetly did we enjoy one another's company. Comforting, animating, and instructing it was. I had renewed cause to conclude it was well worthwhile to strive to do right yet.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-06-15"><dateline><date when="1815-06-15">15.</date></dateline><p> Was quarterly meeting at Evesham and our dear cousin, <persName key="w6wh3qkh">N. Hunt</persName>, had very extensive, searching service. Indeed, he seemed to get through and to saving clear to his own peace and satisfaction and to the great satisfaction of his friends, as appeared by the endorsement on his certificate now given him, and John Shoemaker of Pennsylvania also said considerable. Is become an able minister, though but young in the ministry. An highly favored, open, owning time, although there were much signs of an earthly, dull spirit in some who should, and would if they had kept their places, been as standard bearers, who were closely searched out.</p>
<p>I forgot to put it in its place above; our worthy cousin and his companions, Benjamin Gillingham and Josiah Albertson of Pennsylvania, after dining at Hannah and her sister's – Lippincott's – and having a lively sitting in the family where were several young men. And one, though he looked pretty hardy was reached and tendered. They came home with us to lodge and went with me to select meeting and dined at our son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName>. Precious was their company at our house. Indeed, I suppose or believe that our cousin <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan Hunt</persName>, <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName>, and Jesse Hersey are looked upon and allowed to be the three greatest ministers in America. <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan Hunt</persName> and <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> were natives of Carolina, brought up with little if any more school than so as to be capable of reading the Scriptures and writing a letter, etc., and Jesse Hersey was put apprentice to a potter, his school learning small as the others'. Yet the tongue of the learned is given them and they are very great orators and often use every sublime language. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> said lately that <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName>, <persName key="w6wh3qkh">Nathan's</persName> father, was the greatest man Carolina ever held, and I heard him once say fifty years ago at Haddonfield Quarterly Meeting that he was like something picked up in the wilderness in Carolina and when a little turned of 14 years of age, a gift of the ministry was committed to his trust. And a great and powerful minister he was, a son of thunder like some of old; I heard of his preaching 4 hours at a time once. But Paul continued his speech until midnight and then talked a great while till break of day etc. Oh, the unspeakable mercy of our great Creator continued to this day, as formerly when he said I will send for hunters and hunt them and fishers and fish them and set watchmen over them,<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 16:16</note> saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet and to give the alarm as faithful watchmen when they seeth enemy approaching in an earthly, easeful, lukewarm state threatening great desolation at this time which they faithfully testified against in a powerful awakening manner. Is there any people favored in like degree with such watchmen? We hear that the malignant fever prevails in an alarming manner at Ohio and Redstone and of the death of several very stout young people lately are dead with it: Thomas Warrington who was lately here, and Enoch Cattle and his wife, Elijah Frinch and Jonah Cadwallader, all very stout, lusty, and strong – and that it has been very mortal in Carolina, Virginia, and divers other places.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1815-06-18"><dateline><date when="1815-06-18">18 of the Sixth Month, 1815.</date></dateline><p> First Day. At our meeting and through unmerited mercy, I believe, it was a lively, owning time with some. Amos Hilburn, a young minister of Byberry, Pennsylvania, was there and had acceptable service. I went with him to Westfield in the afternoon to a meeting he had appointed, which seemed low and poor at first. He seemed to have hard, dull work getting along at first, but it growed better and ended very well at last. At our meeting, an invitation was given to the burial of Edmund Darling, Junior of Evesham, a stout, healthy, young man about 18 or 19. It is said he was there at our meeting the First Day before in perfect health; was killed with the kick of a horse on his breast; lived after the kick about 48 hours and was so well as to walk about the room on First Day morning and his parents left him and went to meeting, but he died before they got back. I have thought that when he was at our meeting the First Day before, how alarming would it have been to him if he had been told that an invitation would be given to his own burial the next First Day! There has been several very alarming calls to that family within a few years; one of their daughters but a few months ago from a very small wound died suddenly with the lock jaw, and a young man got hurt at the moving of a building and died there, and his wife had a very bad spell of sickness, and one of their other daughters become quite a cripple through a spell of sickness. So it is, call after call after divers ways and diver manners. Several times I have seemingly narrowly escaped being killed with the kick of a horse and how greatly was our worthy friend <persName key="w6x16z80">John Reves</persName> once wounded with the kick of a horse and once almost killed with a fall out of his carriage. <note type="authorial" place="right margin"><persName key="w6x16z80">John Reve</persName> buried 10 of First Month 1816.</note></p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-06-22"><dateline><date when="1815-06-22">22.</date></dateline><p> Was our preparative meeting. Something very lively and savory first sitting, so that it seemed a little like what I have seen of the account amongst our Friends in early times. When they met at a meeting for discipline, there was such a flowing of life that one after another had so much to communicate that they were forced to adjourn and so again when they met the second time, till they adjourned the 3rd time before they could go to the business of the discipline. But our discipline meeting was not altogether satisfactory to me. They have a right to censure who have an heart to help and none else. What is our discipline but poor, dry formality without an heart to help? The shepherds of Israel were complained of formerly because they had not sought after the scattered of the flock, them that had been driven away, nor endeavored to heal the sick lame and wounded,<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 34:2-4</note> etc.</p>

Just the beginning of harvest.</p>
<p>Seventh Day. A very wet morning.

<div type="entry" n="1815-07-16"><dateline><date when="1815-07-16">16.</date></dateline><p> First Day. My neighbor, Samuel Church took me to Westfield meeting, which to me was middling satisfactory, although great lukewarmness and trifling indifferency and drowsiness; a spirit of ease invades our meetings. We dined at William Burrough's. <persName key="w6jx3293">Thomas Lippincott</persName>, William Evans and I went to see Joseph Morgan and inform him of the judgment of the Monthly Meeting for his paying a fine or demand for military demands. To some satisfaction in clearing ourselves, although he seemed settled on his dues. This week, helping my son getting of hay and got along bravely. Dry weather.</p>
<p>Fifth Day. At our meeting which was small, people very busy amongst their hay. <persName key="w67b4w4h">Joseph Justice</persName> had a pretty deal to say and I thought pretty pertinent and lively with me – I might say another stemed in. I have often thought of a piece of an old Scotch song I have heard. A little old Scotchman used often to sing – My heart's in the highlands / My heart is not here / My heart's in the highland chasing of the deer / A chasing of back and hunting the doe / My heart's in the highlands wherever I go. People may go to meeting and the heart, in the farm, in the earth, draw nigh with all outward appearance whilst the heart far from being rightly centered. See <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge's</persName> <title>Works</title> page 425: he quotes the words of Georgius Magor, a zealous, useful, religious man who asserted that they that were no studious of good works could not obtain eternal life and that the study of good works was necessary to salvation. But our minds seem to be so taken up with the crowding cares and cumbering concerns of this world (especially in the busy season of the year) that very many seem to have no time to study about anything else but for the body.</p>

In <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge's</persName> <title>Works</title> I find these words: it is a great and glorious thing to be a Christian, because we may see the effects of faithfulness to the Christian principle is so great and glorious. It is a great thing and weighty, as <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> observes, to make a profession of the Christian religion as most nowadays do. But as Claridge say, or an author he quotes, that to profess the Christian religion and not walk answerable to it is the greatest enmity to religion and as another observed that truth has ever suffered most from its professed advocates for want of sincerity.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> A fine shower. Very busy getting hay and favored to get along bravely and I helped considerably.</note>
<p>Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting and not the poorest to me, though very small. People very busy about getting hay. I have thought how it would so for an highly professing people in religion and to very great refinement to lay by religion and attending meetings all the busy season of the year. It is recorded that our first friends would tend their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground, or that their persecutors said they would keep up their meetings if their corn dropped in the ground. They then got something by attending their meeting that they could rejoice in more than the increase of corn, wine or oil. And as one of old said, I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.<note type="editorial">Job 23:12</note> For as we read, man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.<note type="editorial">Luke 4:4</note> Then shalt thou delight thyself in the Lord, as Isaiah says,<note type="editorial">Isaiah 58:14</note> and as <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman</persName> remarks, a joy and delight of all others the most pure, and as Habakkuk says, though the fields yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation.<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:17</note> Oh, blessed and happy state to be in, when all earthly comforts fail, which they very soon must.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1815-08-06"><dateline><date when="1815-08-06">6.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I am told a man by the name of Samuel Porch was killed with the thunder near Salem a few weeks ago and that a young new married woman at Salem cut her own throat. They got the doctor and sewed it up and she lived about a week and then it mortified and killed her a few weeks ago, a daughter of Job Tiler. Went to our meeting. Very dry time, waters very low – mortifying, but perhaps profitable. I hear of several dreadful accidents or circumstances. Samuel Middleton of Haddonfield had his arm cut with a scythe; they said the doctors was two hours taking up and tying the veins or arteries. Another had his leg badly mashed and broken helping [to] move a building by a large pry falling on it. Another, by the name of Cliffen, in a dreadful condition so that his life is much despaired of by treading on one of the little, sharp, prickly sand burrs (much increasing and spreading of latter years). They say there is a hole quite through his foot, and his leg swelled up as big as two, and the swelling run up to his body. Another got terribly burnt with powder, and I am told there has been lately a very great rain, a great fresh and two barns burnt with the lightning near New York. Oh, what humbling, solemn calls to fear and faithfulness. The ancient language was fear God and give glory to His great name for the hour of his judgments is come,<note type="editorial">Revelation 14:7</note> and again sanctify the Lord your God and let him be your fear and let him be your dread,<note type="editorial">Isaiah 8:13</note> and as one said, sooner or later he will make all to fear him. And as the prophet said, oh, that men would fear the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful kindness to the children of men,<note type="editorial">Psalm 31:19</note> and again, oh, that there were such an heart in them to fear me always and keep my commandments, that so it might be well with them and their children forever. For the fear of the Lord keeps the heart clean and is a fountain of life that preserves from the snares of death.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Very dry, pinching drought. Went to my son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName>, about smith work. Had one fine shower, yet it seems soon to want more. Shower almost daily round about, yet corn in many places much pinched.</note></div>

<p>This sheet or leaf happened to be left and so I fill it up. The author quoted it and why not [indecipherable].</p>
<p>See <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge's</persName> <title>Works,</title> page 276: An exhortation to faithful obedience to the light of Christ. An excellent piece, at the conclusion of which, page 283, he quotes Archbishops Tillotson's words in sermons on several occasions, etc. It is not our being guided over with the external profession of Christianity that will avail us; our religion must be a vital principle, inwardly to change and transform us. If by our lives and actions we do contradict that religion which we profess, we do by this very thing prove ourselves to be counterfeits and hypocrites. If a man profess any other art or calling, it is expected that he should be skilled in it and excel those that do not pretend to it. Tis the greatest disparagement to a physician that can be to say of him that he is in other respects an excellent man, only he hath no great skill in diseases and the methods of cure – because this is his profession. He might be pardoned for other defects, but the proper skill of his art may justly be expected from him. So for a Christian to say of him, the worst thing in him is his life. He is very orthodox in his opinions, but he is an ill-natured man, one of very violent passions. He will be very frequently drunk, he makes no conscience of his dealings, he is very uncharitable to all that differ from him. This man is faulty in his profession; he is defective in that which should be his excellency. He may have orthodox opinions in religion, but when all is done there is no such error and heresy, nothing so fundamentally opposite to religion, as a wicked life.  He that would know what a man believes let him attend rather for what he does than to what he talks. He that leads a wicked life makes a more credible and effectual profession of infidelity than he who in words only denies the gospel. It is the hardest thing in the world to imagine that the man believes Christianity who by ungodliness and worldly lusts does deny and renounce it. The greatest enmity to religion is to profess it and live unanswerably to it; A Jew or a Turk is not so great an enemy to Christianity as a lewd and vicious Christian.</p>
<p>A Christian does not pretend to have a better wit and a more piercing understanding than a Turk or a heathen, but he professes to live better than they, to be more chaste and more temperate man, more just and more charitable, more meek and gentle, more loving and peaceable than other men. If any man professes himself a Christian and do not live better than others, he is a mere pretender and mountebank in religion. And then pressing all those who call themselves Christians to live up to the essential and fundamental laws of religion, the same author sums this up under these heads: to love God and to love our neighbor, to do to every man as we would have him do to us, to mortify our lusts and subdue our passions and sincerity, to endear to grow in every grace and virtue and to abound in all the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ to the praise and glory of God. These are undoubtedly the essential and fundamental laws of religion or Christianity, and they that are found in obedience thereunto are the only true Christians, because they do what Christ requires of them and give up in faithful obedience to his holy and pure divine light, which supports and comforts them under all exercises and temptations; sweetens every cup, though never so bitter to flesh and blood; enables them to surmount all difficulties they meet with; works out all that is of the dark, sinful nature; sanctifies them throughout and makes them meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.</p>

<p>See <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge's</persName> work, page 141: among his manuscripts written this year 1703 is found a paper of pious instruction penned for the use of his own daughter, which we here transcribe for the good of others, especially of our youth:</p>
<p>John IV: 24 God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. Spiritual worship and none other is acceptable to him. And therefore that thou mayst worship him in spirit and in truth, turn thy mind inward to the light and spirit of Christ in thy own heart, and wait in silence of thy own thoughts, reasonings and words that the Lord may prepare thy heart and provide himself a sacrifice. Keep low and humble at all times, in all places and in all companies, waiting upon thy Heavenly teacher Christ Jesus to hear his voice and to be taught and instructed by him who will draw nigh unto thee as thou drawest nigh unto him and will guide thee with his council as thou givest up in obedience to him. The meek will he guide in judgment, And the meek will he teach his way, Psalms XXV 9. Be frequent in self-examination, and as thou findest any thing in thee that is offensive to the Lord, cry unto him to take it away and to strengthen thee against it and all evil for the time to come. Be always upon thy watch lest the enemy get an advantage over thee and draw thy mind out to the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye and the pride of life. Do not neglect anything that truth commands, nor count anything little that truth forbids, but have a diligent regard to all its requirings.</p>
<p>If others should take more liberty than the truth allows, do, thou neither imitate such nor have society with them. Bad examples and bad company are very dangerous, and therefore avoid them as thou wouldst do an infection.</p>
<p>Have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but walk in the light of the lamb continually. So shalt thou be a witness of his work, which is to take away the sin of the world. Be faithful to what the Lord hath made known unto thee and as thou art faithful in a little he will make the ruler ever much. He hath given thee the manifestation of his spirit to profit with all. Oh, be not slothful and negligent but give diligence that thy profiting may appear. Learn and practice the lesson of self-denial and take up thy daily cross to the world and everything that is evil in it. The cross is the way to the crown. Thou mayst meet with scoffs and jeers, with revilings and reproaches for the truth's sake. But when thou art reviled, revile not again; when thou art reproached, bear it patiently and commit thyself to him who judgeth righteously. If ye be reproached (saith Peter) for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you 1 Peter IV: 14. Again, if any suffer as a Christian (that is, upon the account of Christ and his blessed truth), let him not be ashamed but glorify God on this behalf. IV: 16: Blessed are ye, saith Christ, when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my name's sake, rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you Matthew 5:11-12. Choose for thy companions such as excel in piety and virtue. Mind not the outward turnings of the world, but the inward adorning, the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of God of great price, for so the holy women in old times who trusted in God adorned themselves.</p>
<p>Be friendly and courteous towards all, and particularly toward thy uncle and aunt, and bear if anything seem hard at any time.</p>
<p>Be no teller of tales, nor busybody in other folks matters. Cause no strife or discord, nor render evil for evil or railing for railing. Disclose not a secret, nor lay open the faults of others. Keep thyself as much as possible to thyself. Be affable, not open; be courteous, not fond or foolish; be as wise as a serpent and innocent as a dove. Watch, pray and patiently continue in well-doing and perfect peace will be thy portion here and eternal glory thy crown hereafter. So have I been employed this 13 of the First Month 1816 with desires that every one of my granddaughters might be furnished with a copy of this precious instruction. A great snow on the ground and freezing cold and see <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridige's</persName> <title>Works</title>.

He is a very great minister, lately visited Europe. I have almost concluded to stop writing this way, but feel not quite easy. But see a little book lately from England wrote by William Alexander<note type="editorial">William Alexander, Christian discipline, public religious worship, and gospel ministry, briefly considered. York [Eng.]: Printed for the author, 1814.</note>, page 115, a very excellent piece: as exercise of the body promotes the comfort and health of our earthly tabernacles, so exercise of the soul, patiently and rightly maintained, promotes the health and vigor of this noble and immortal part of man. Whatever may be our stage of experience or our relative situations as members of the body, this exercise or engagement of mind is essential. Is it not like putting wood on the altar daily to keep it burning, etc.?</p>
<p>Further say W[illiam] A[lexander] in same page, this exercise must be attended to by all sorts growths and experience in our individual capacities, at home in our families or about our lawful occasions. This inward exercises is attended with safety. The effects is righteousness and its reward is peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. It is better to wear away than rust away, I often think.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1815-08-13"><dateline><date when="1815-08-13">13.</date></dateline><p> At our select quarterly meeting at Haddonfield. Forepart very dull, poor and low as I thought, and at last <persName key="w6gq882n">R. Jordan</persName> said he that it had been a low, dull time. But Henry Hull of the state of New York, one of our greatest ministers, was there and labored through all and had very extensive, excellent service, and it ended savory and satisfactory to me. I find it is so; if I can but answer my own conscience, I need fear no man, as <persName key="w6q061bh">Stephen Crisp</persName> says and another of more ancient date, the righteous are as bold as a lion.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 28:1</note></p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Very warm indeed.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-08-14"><dateline><date when="1815-08-14">14.</date></dateline><p> Quarterly meeting. <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> first and then Henry Hull had very great service, large and powerful. Both spoke against an easeful state as to religion and about the great scramble and scuffle after earthly treasures etc., which produces formality and a lethargic stupefaction as to religion. The weather was so hot and trying, I was overcome and could not sit meeting for business. I think it a great merry and a wonder – which it is to be feared is not enough considered – that that such a succession of lively, powerful gospel ministers should be continued to us as of old. Also, I set watchmen over you saying, hearken to the sound of the trumpet, etc. The people formerly were threatened with a famine of the word, etc., but they said we will not hearken.<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 6:17</note> And what is the expressive language of conduct of many now? View and compare our present state with the state of our worthy predecessors, when the prisons were filled all over the nation, and as William Edmundson said their fare was very mean and lodging on straw, but the Lord was with them and made bread and water as satisfactory to them as the most delicious dainties and prisons and dungeons more pleasant than places without the Lord's favor. We read the great master dined on barley bread and fish, and as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> say, not likely any great delicacy in cooking them and of those that lived in caves and dens of the earth, wandering in sheep skins and goatskins, having no certain dwelling place.<note type="editorial">Hebrews 11:37</note> and of John, whose meat was locust and wild honey and a leather girdle about his loins<note type="editorial">Matthew 3:4</note> These are they of whom it was said, the world was not worthy of them.<note type="editorial">Hebrews 11:38</note></p>
<p>But let us take a view of our present state: riding to meeting in great state, like Parliament men with nice, fat, well matched horses, gilded harness, glittering chariots (jumping chariots as the prophet says<note type="editorial">Nahum 3:2</note> ), exceeding all the societies on earth. A great change indeed, from that of laying on straw and enduring many years imprisonment, when hundred died in prisons with suffering and hardship. The primitive Christians used to say prosperity was a very intoxicating thing and few brains were strong enough to bear it.</p>
<p>And Seneca says: prosperity, like a strong gale, presently carries us out of sight of peace. To see the road filled with carriages for miles together of the most shining delicate sort, shining like looking glasses, made me think of the words of the prophet: their land is full of silver and gold, there is no end to their treasures; their land also is full of horses, there is no end to their chariots. They worship the works of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made,<note type="editorial">Isaiah 2:7-8</note> and is it not greatly to be feared that the hearts of many are too much taken up with and entangled and bemired with these conveniences? If we look back a few years we may see the advances in these things have been very rapid and very great, surpassing all the societies on earth or however I know not of any that exhibits such a show at our meetings and burials, etc. It is said some of their carriages cost three hundred dollars. If the expense were applied to the use of the poor, would it not be an acceptable sacrifice to the Lord? It robs the poor and does but please the wanton, as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says.</p></div>

<p>Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. A lively one to me, a little of that which casts out fear.

Cousin <persName key="w6g77m31">Hannah Yarnall</persName> of Byberry, Pennsylvania came to see us and told us two children near where she lives were killed with the thunder Seventh Day evening. The heavy black cloud was in full view before us; as we drew near the toll bridge, we seen the very sharp lightning. Another very heavy shower was behind us up in Evesham and violent hard thunder near Bourton's mill. Two oak trees tore all to pieces with the thunder. One that seen them said he did not think the oldest man living could say they ever seen the like, they were so torn up root and branch. Are not these awful displays of Almighty power far surpassing human power?</p>
<p>We went with our cousin <persName key="w6g77m31">Hannah Yarnall</persName> and her son James to see our cousin, <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName>, where we had a satisfactory visit and a comfortable sitting with the children and family at last.</p>

<p>On Fourth Day Simon Gilum and Jeremiah Crossdill of Pennsylvania appointed a meeting at Moorestown. It was very large, a full meeting. Came off middling, to me it was a low time, could not stir. I dined at Samuel Church's with the strangers, and divers neighbors were there, and we had an opportunity with their hopeful, innocent children and family; for the better, it seemed to me to be.</p>
<p>Sixth Day. My daughter <persName key="w6136j8n">Hannah</persName> and I went to Cropwell, to a meeting appointed by Simon Gilum, which I thought was but small and but dull. Yet Simon and <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName> had very acceptable service; it was with me like some formerly. Whist I was making ready another stepped in, etc. This afternoon I heard Israel Middletown, a healthy young man, son of N.M., was to be buried at Moorestown and had lived near there. He was at meeting last First Day as well as usual, was taken very ill as he was at work in the field with the bilious colic on Second Day and died on Fifth Day. He lived with his father and it's like had the chief care of the farm. Oh, what solemn awful call to the young, stout, and strong! But strange and sorrowful to see what little effect or impressions it makes – seems they seem soon forgotten although the repeated calls of mortality.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1815-10-01"><dateline><date when="1815-10-01">1 of Tenth Month.</date></dateline><p> First Day. My friend Samuel Church took me in his chair up to Upper Evesham meeting, where they have lately built a very large, famous meeting house and it was almost filled and through continued mercy it was an open, owning, satisfactory time to me and there was tokens of its being so to many others. The love, feeling nearness, and pleasantness after meeting was such that I never seen the like there before. Went to Joshua Stokes's to dine, where I left in his care some things I had collected for a very poor widow and her children up in The Pines where I had a meeting some months ago.</p>

I thought something savory and lively attended the meeting throughout and satisfactory to me. This day heard of the death of Thomas Lawrey of Piles Grove, a minister in very good esteem, not very far advanced in years but left a number of children, a choice, sweet-spirited man. I was very intimately acquainted with him have been very kindly entertained at his house and he with us here not very long ago. He visited the meetings here about and paid us a very kind, acceptable visit. Another grievous account – James Frinch, his wife got disordered in her mind or somewhat deranged and he gone to the Ohio to see his relations there. She has been disordered in mind some before they say and it is said sickness much prevails towards Salem and Piles Grove. Several deaths of late, it is thought, seemed occasioned by a bilious or typhus or nervous fever. I believe the doctors hardly know what to call them. Divers very uncommon strange disorders of latter years; some have lost their senses, some their rearing and I think some their sight.</p>

We met with an open reception; although the steward and his wife inclined to join the Methodists, they were very kind to us and I believe the meeting was to general satisfaction. Lidia Lippincott, I thought, was evidently owned and favored. I have had this visit in view several months past and have waited for suitable company, was glad I was there. I seen some of my old acquaintance had got there whom I have not seen since we were apprentices together at Moorestown and playmates. One of these said several times he never was more glad to see anybody in his life. Some were tendered, I believe, to tears in meeting. Many of them are reduced to poverty by drinking to excess. Several poor women with sucking babes in their arms; and several black people. They at parting expressed thankfulness for our noticing them and for our visit – divers after their way desiring the Lord might bless us. Although it is about twenty miles, I got well home in the evening.</p>

Behold, said one of old, what a great matter a little fire kindleth.<note type="editorial">James 3:5</note> What slippery places we stand in and walk in what need of continual watchfulness and prayer for preservation from evil! This the prophet experienced when he said, my steps had well nigh slept – see Psalms 73:2. The cloud went off, the man returned to his business and we got in our buckwheat and most of our potatoes. It caused me to think and consider how many we read of in Scripture and down to this day who have slipped and grievously fell from small cases – not only individuals, but whole nations. As <persName key="w63j7f09">Peter Charron</persName> and <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName>  remarks, whole nations have been thrown into dismal wars, desolation, destruction, and ruin from very small causes, very small indeed: as the not striking a flag or the not saluting a garrison, to the loss of thousands and thousands of lives. And all this for want of true religion, as that great warrior Washington now so much extolled amongst Americans. He says, of all the dispositions and habits which lead to the prosperity of a nation, says Washington, religion is the indispensable support; volumes could not trace all its connections with private and public happiness. I unite with his sentences in praise of religion, but not with his conduct as a warrior.</p>

Seventh Day, 25th of the Eleventh Month, 1815. Heard of the death of <persName key="w6ph2gz9">Rebeckah Roberts</persName>, who died in the 96th year of her age. We paid her a visit a few weeks ago; she could converse on religious subjects sensibly. She was an approved, acceptable minister and left a good savor. Her husband has been dead about twenty years. Oh, how a little time sweeps off one generation after another! She was about twenty years older than myself. I have been very poorly some time with the prevailing disorder called the influenza; it seems like a bad cold in the head and stomach. From accounts it is a general complaint through the country and cities, of which some have died very suddenly, choke, they say, with the phlegm.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> Weather very fine and moderate. I, poorly, confined to the house.</note>
<p>I am told a young man near Haddonfield died with the lock-jaw by running a nail in his foot and of an alarm about mad dogs and that several people were bit with them about or towards Gloucester.

Is it not then the time for the good remembrancer to bring into our minds the most interesting, profitable things? Is not this state of safety in the silence of all flesh the state of Israel abiding in their tents, where no enchantments could prevail against them? Is it not the state David so earnestly desired when he said, oh, send out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me and let them teach me and bring me to thy holy hill and to thy tabernacle?<note type="editorial">Psalms 43:5-4</note> Are not these things a mystery hid from ages and nations, are they not a mystery to thousands that frequently and constantly attend silent meetings?

Is it not the way everlasting or that will last forever when all other ways fail? Are not those who are fixed and settled in this state of true stillness, in the silence of all flesh, settled on that rock against which the gates of Hell can never prevail? And is not this all that is wanting to attain to a state wherein we can truly say, thy will be done? For is it not so as that worthy minister <persName key="w67h3crq">Joseph White</persName> said I never found that when I well did predominate in me that I ever stood rightly situated for to receive divine instruction? Is it not very likely that thousands and hundreds of thousands are constantly saying and respecting this, thy kingdom come, thy will be done etc., and still yet continue to do their own wills and so never come into a state and situation suitable to receive divine instruction? Is not this the promise, they that do my will shall know of my doctrine<note type="editorial">John 7:17</note> But for want of this, how few ever come to reap the benefit of the Scriptures as the faithful in ages past have done, although many seem to value them highly.

<p>See newspaper <title>Trenton Federalist</title>, October 2, 1815, No 866: Boston, September 25 is an account of a very destructive storm, the like not known since the settlement of the country. After a long account of the dreadful destruction of this storm they say at last: but the most calamitous part remains yet to be mentioned. We have to lament (besides those wounded and maimed) the death of some industrious, valuable citizens – some carried with their houses into the water and others crushed to death between the planks and the vessels as they dashed through the bridge. How many lives were lost or how much property destroyed is not yet ascertained. Since the inundation subsided, the military have been constantly on duty to prevent the pillage of the remaining property which was exposed. New London, Stonington and Gratton in Connecticut suffered severely by the above storm. Further eastward the wind was not so violent. This storm was an awful display of Almighty power, no doubt an awful, terrifying time like the land of Median [Midian] and the tents of Cushan. The prophet said, I saw the tents of Cushan in great affliction and the curtains of the land of Median [Midian] did tremble.<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:7</note> Many a city and country have been brought into a state of terror and trembling by divers ways and divers means. An awful, solemn call and visitation. See Isaiah 29 and 6 verse: thou shalt be visited with a storm; and Nahum 1:3 verse: the Lord hath his way in the whirlwind and storm; Mark 4 and 37 there arose a great storm; Psalms 107:25 he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind; 148:8 snow, and vapor; stormy wind fulfilling his word; Ezekiel 13:11 hail stones shall fall, stormy wind shall rend; and 13 I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; Psalms 107:29 he maketh the storm a calm, the waves are still; Isaiah 4:6 and for a covert from storm and from rain; and 25:4 for thou hast been a refuge from the storm. See Psalms 55:6-8: oh, that I had wings like a dove (the wings of faith, of hope, and of love), I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest and 83:15 and make them afraid with thy storm. See Matthew 7 and 24: therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man that built his house upon a rock; 25 and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock, etc.; 26-7: and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man that built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it. See Job 1:19: and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead, etc. A poor black man drowned crossing the creek on ice at timber creek.</p>

See <persName key="w6wf3zbk">Richard Claridge's</persName> <title>Works, </title>page 574, Some passages transcribed out of his commonplace book. This is the conclusion of his book, and as he thought these passages worthy of preserving in his commonplace book, why may not I also, viz.: there are two different states of men. One is where sin prevails. In the other, religion and goodness takes palce [place?]. These two differ in degrees as wide as Heaven and Hell, which places we must not believe to be all hereafter. For both the one and the other are in some measure begun here on Earth. They that are made like unto God in the frame and temper of their minds, who live according to the everlasting and unchangeable rules of goodness, righteousness, and truth may be properly said to have made their entrance already into Heaven. But they who confound the difference of good and evil, who care not to approve themselves to God by leading good and Holy lives do partake of the diabolical nature and are already entered into the state of Hell.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="margin"> See four leaves back, more quotations from R.C. works.</note>
<p>John Hartcliffe's <title>Treaties of Moral and Intellectual Virtues</title>, Edition 1691, Preface page 25-26: The first thing in religion is to refine a man's temper and the second is to govern his practice; for if it do not mend men's spirits and regulate their lives, it is much inferior to any principle in nature which is sufficient to and doth attain its effect. But the grace of God suspended to the reason of our minds is of strength sufficient to subdue all the temptations to evil. Ibid, preface, p. 26.</p>
<p>The Scripture doth everywhere speak of moral virtue as the foundation of all revealed and instituted religion, and therefore our saviour, when he was asked which was the first and great commandment of the law, answers: thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself.<note type="editorial">Matthew 22:38-40</note> A Jew would have thought that he would have pitched upon some of these things which were in so great esteem among them: sacrifices, circumcision, or the Sabbath – but he overlooks all these and instances in the two principal duties of morality: the love of God and our neighbor. And these moral duties are those he calls the law and the prophets and which he came not to destroy but to fulfill, for the judicial and ceremonial law of the Jews was to be perpetual and immutable, which whosoever neglects, he can never please God with any

instituted or positive part of religion. And throughout the Old Testament nothing is declared more abominable to him than sacrifice as long as men allowed themselves in wicked practices. And in the New Testament the Christian religion chiefly designs to teach mankind righteousness, godliness and sobriety. And for this end was the glorious appearance of the great God and our saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Ibid., page 408-409.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> I seldom knew a greater snow and very freezing cold.</note>
<p>In the description of the day of judgment, men are represented by our Savior as called to an account both as to the practice and neglect of moral duties and no others are instanced in to shew what place he intended they should have in his religion. All positive institutions must give way to moral duties because God hath declared that he would rather have mercy than sacrifice. And whosoever violates any natural law, he undermines the very foundation of religion, Ibid p. 410. Piety towards God, righteousness, justice, and charity towards men are more pleasing to God and more valuable than if he should offer to him all the beasts of the forests or the cattle upon a thousand hills. For to the first observance of these duties we are directed and obliged by our very nature and the most sacred laws which God hath written upon our hearts. And that we might have no pretence to take us off from them, God hath freed us in the Gospel from those many observances and burdensome ceremonies where with the religion of the Jews was encumbered that we might better mind moral duties and live in the practice of them, Ibid. pp. 411-412.</p>
<p>See <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn's</persName> <title>Reflections</title>, page 25. He says useless studies are a busy idleness. And see [<persName key="w66696rh">Lindley Murray's</persName>] <title>Power of Religion on the Mind, </title>page 42 and 44: Solmacius, a man of uncommon abilities, when he arrived at the evening of life and had to reflect on the work of his day, he acknowledged he had mistaken true learning and that in which solid happiness consisted and exclaimed thus against himself: oh, I have lost a world of time, that most precious thing in the world! Oh, said he to those about him, mind the world less and God more. The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom and to depart from evil is good understanding and see same book, <title>Power of Religion on the Mind</title>, page 39 and 40, concerning that great man Hugh Grotius: to one that admired his great industry, he returned an answer to this effect: ah, I have consumed much of my life in laborious doing nothing! And to another that inquired of his wisdom and learning what course to take, he solemnly answered: be serious. Now if useless studies and useless labors are a busy idleness, what abundance of idleness and loss of precious time there is! The Scriptures say work whilst it is called to day, lay up for yourselves treasure in heaven etc..<note type="editorial">Matthew 6:20</note> and to see the scramble, as <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> said the other day, after the things of this world, after earthly treasure – hardly a stone left unturned. What voyages they will make, what journeys they will take to procure independent estates to the hazard of health and life and some shorten their days in their career and scramble and so die martyrs for money. Some last words of T. H., a man I knew who had a plentiful estate and careful in my dealings amongst man and to pay every man his due; but as to the great work of my souls salvation, I have not done so much as the moving the least grain of sand. And indeed so it seems to be: they that seems most in earnest to lay up treasure on earth seem least concerned and most unconcerned and stupid about laying up treasures in Heaven and without which all their labor is at last a useless, busy, idleness. As Solomon says, all is vanity and vexation of spirit<note type="editorial">Ecclesiastes 1:2 </note> Then at last ten thousand of worlds for peace with the Lord.</p></div>

We may remember the words of Christ to Martha and Mary: Martha, Martha thou art careful about many things; one thing is needful,<note type="editorial">Luke 10:41-42</note> and what is this one thing needful but the mercy and favor of God's? They that seek that first (as we are commanded) seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness and all things needful shall be added. So they that obtain this obtain all they need and they that neglect and miss of obtaining this one thing needful, they loose all, and all their studies are but a busy idleness and they consume their time in laborious doing of nothing.</p>
<p>But if useless studies are a busy idleness, certainly useful studies are a very profitable exercise. For the apostle recommends it, and commands it: study to shew thyself approved in the sight of God.<note type="editorial">2 Timothy 2:15</note> And they were and are pronounced blessed whose meditations were in the law of the Lord day and night.

Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. So shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man,<note type="editorial">Proverbs 6:9-11</note> useless studies unprofitable thoughts. As William Shewin<note type="editorial"><title>Counsel to the Christian Traveler</title></note> says, vain unprofitable thoughts are great troublers of the world. David says I hate vain thoughts but thy law do I love<note type="editorial">Psalm 119:113</note> and Paul says he had something to do to put away unprofitable thoughts and the prophet says, wash thy heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 4:14</note> And again says another, as I walked by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding, so it was all grown over with thorns, etc. I saw and considered it well; I looked upon it and received instruction.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 24:30-31</note> But I believe this spiritual idleness, this useless study, this laborious doing of nothing is far the worst of the two sorts of idleness and most fatal. Although there are too many who are so lazy, idle, careless, and trifling as not to take care for even their poor bodies and became a burden to their fellow creatures. These are, and have been in ages and nations past, abhorred amongst the generality of their fellow creatures, so that some have said if the devil finds a man idle, he will set him to work. Idleness is the mother of mischief and again, according to <persName key="w63j7f09">Charron</persName>, the Spaniards used to say, all men are tempted of the Devil, but an idle man really tempts the Devil.</p>

Every soul here present that with seriousness of mind shall ask of God what their state and condition is if they were to die presently, God will tell them. He will answer them by the light of his son Jesus Christ and let them know whether they are in the gall of bitterness or and in the bonds of their iniquity still or whether they are redeemed out of it, etc. And does not the apostle say, if any man lack wisdom let him ask it of God who gives liberally and upbraids none?<note type="editorial">James 1:5</note></p>

He has been lately much shut up and almost overwhelmed with trouble with his children, but seem like to float again. This day a young man from near the New Mills or county poor house came here to beg relief. He told me that a few weeks ago his house was burnt and two children (which was all he had) was burnt in it and a considerable sum of money, several hundred dollars. He and his wife went to see a sick neighbor very near, put their children to sleep and put wood in the stove, and it was thought it took fire from the stove pipe which went up through the floor. I could mention several other instances of several houses being burnt and several children burnt in them. A few years ago one near Toll Bridge three children burnt in and one at Timber Creek and several burnt to death in it.</p></div>

<p>Yesterday my beloved friend <persName key="w6p953wx">Nathan Smith</persName> came to see us with William Evans and wife, and a pleasant social visit it was and at last had a little religious opportunity to profit, I hope.</p></div>

Several of us had something to say, and life and savor did increase and it ended very lively and savory, I believe. A strengthening time to me.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1816-02-21"><dateline><date when="1816-02-21">21.</date></dateline><p> I went to the burial of our neighbor, Joseph Hewlings, a very working, capable man in worldly business in the midst of his days and pursued it with great eagerness. There was a great number of people who behaved very soberly, and I had a very open, satisfactory time with them. People were very courteous and respectful at parting. He died with the dropsy, brought on it was thought by getting in a great heat mowing hay and then drinking cold water.</p></div>
