				<p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

				<p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
				<p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
				<p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<p><note type="structure">Written sideways under this date</note>
This was the day I first gave up to say a few words in a public First Day meeting. In great diffidence, dread and fear a strong persuasion attended my mind that if I did give up to speak all and even <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> would detest and abhor me (which I believe was the works of the enemy) for I found it quite otherwise for <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> spoke comfortably and encouragingly and indeed I believe I needed it, for I was almost ready to sink so that some said they pitied me. But an healing peace followed of was such a reward of confirmation that I have thought since it never would be erased come on me what will or may, and this letter from my dear cousin I received when I came out of meeting which was an healing cordial to me.<note type="editorial">The published version of Hunt's Journal, 221-222, provides a slightly altered wording of this passage: <q>This day, at our meeting, I first gave up to say a few words, I think, in great diffidence, dread and fear: a strong persuasion having attended my mind (which I since believe was the enemy's work) that if I did give up thus to expose myself in a public meeting, all would despise and abhor me, - even my bosom friend, and nearest connections: but I found it quite otherwise, for many of them, and especially , my wife, owned me in it, and spoke very comforting and encouragingly to me. The few words I had to communicate in that meeting were as follows: I believe it is needful, and would be profitable, when we are thus met together, diligently to watch against all such thoughts as we know ought not to have place in our minds. After I sat down, I felt such quietude, peace and composure, and a love that seemed to me to be new, that for some days I felt as if I had got into a new world. I loved not only my nearest connections, but all mankind, and even brutile creation, with a new love. This was such a confirmation of my being right, that I though it would never be erased, come on me what might. I felt as if I could turn my back on the world, and, if required, live like a hermit in the wilderness. Notwithstanding this confirmation of having been in my place at that time, I began to think that if ever it should be required of me again to say any thing in a public meeting, I should have a still more clear evidence of duty. Under this conclusion, I put off, and deferred speaking again for nearly a year; until I was in great danger of being quite bewildered on that hand. But as this kind of reasoning and false conclusion produced unsettlement, disquietude, and confusion of mind, so I found it safest to yield obedience to the clear manifestations of duty, without making a standard of my own.</q></note></p></div>
