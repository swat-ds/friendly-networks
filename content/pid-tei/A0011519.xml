				<p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

				<p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
				<p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
				<p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<div type="entry" n="1776-12-24"><head><supplied>December 1776</supplied></head>
<dateline><date when="1776-12-24">Memorandum 24th of the Twelfth Month, 1776.</date></dateline>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> See Jeremiah chapter 48 and 16 verse. Moab's calamity is near and affliction hasteth fast</note>
	<p>About this time things did work together in a strange manner. About the 15th of this Twelfth Month great fear fell on our neighborhood we being in full expectation of the English army down upon us so that there was great to do moving of goods and talk of hiding of earthly treasure and I suppose a great deal of that was done in many places, but things seemed to turn very strange and unexpected. About the 22 of the Twelfth Month the two armies met at Mount Holly and had a skirmish. The Americans were drove out of the town and came back to the Moorestown and by reports the Hessians*<note type="authorial" place="left margin">* Read Deuteronomy 28 Chapter and 49:50:51 verses</note> or the English party did strip many very much at that time in Mount Holly. See Jeremiah 15: 12 and 13: verse 14, See Jeremiah 11: 17: 19 and Genesis VI <supplied>or VII</supplied> and 11 and Isaiah 24:5, Jeremiah 11:34 verse. Maybe twenty years before this Mount Holly was a remarkably highly favored place. But there was an admirable strange turn, for as was reported about the 26 of the month a very stormy day some hundreds of the Hessians or of the English party were taken prisoners at Trenton and brought to Philadelphia and the rest drove back towards Brunswick.</p>
	<p>And at this time there was a mournful work taking up several of the leading or active men some of one side and some of the other, too tedious to mention in particular. I was told that one Isaac Piercal was shot about this time who had been a justice of peace. Lives above Burlington. Some put in prison on suspicion of being party takers on one side and some on the other. See <persName key="w6wr0v4m">John Woolman's</persName> book, page 174 and 175 and 176 and see Zephaniah 1: 17 and 18.</p>
	<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> *See Jeremiah 51 and 46, Ruler against ruler etc</note>
	<p>One thing at this time was very remarkable and pretty much noticed by the people. About the middle of the Second Month John Hay near Haddonfield got several men to join him and went to a Negro man's house with clubs and laid claim to and attempted to take away one of the Negro man's sons, where upon a very great quarrel ensued and some very heavy blows passed between them. The Negro man got very much bruised. The Negro boy hid and they were forced to go away without him, a neighbor being called in the fray and stopped them, or it was thought that there was a danger of being murder done amongst them. The Negro man applied to authority to get satisfaction but the affair drop without a great deal to do.</p>
	<p>But now about the middle of the Twelfth Month this [John] Hay was at Haddonfield at a tavern amongst the soldiers. A quarrel began and he in the fray got very much wounded being stabbed with bayonets in his belly so that at this time he is under the doctor's hands, and no way expected to recover. He was favored to get up again after great illness.</p>
	<p>See Zephaniah 11:3 Seek ye the Lord all ye meek of the Earth which have wrought his judgments. Such righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the Lord's anger.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1777-01-22"><head><supplied>January 1777</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1777-01-22">About the 22nd of the First Month 1777 </date></dateline><p> there was a very great commotion and troubles amongst us. People were afraid of traveling the great roads because of the soldiers. Six of our neighbors being taken up pressed and put in Burlington gaol because they would not sign or associate with them. Some others did sign and so were sent home on conditions to return to them when called on. This was a very sore trying time with many in Evesham who had lived carelessly. Remember the inhabitants of Laish: see Jeremiah 15: 19: Let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them: 20 And I will make unto this people a fenced brazen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for I am with them to save thee and to deliver thee saith the Lord. About this time <persName key="w6tv5gh9">Mark Miller</persName> and <persName key="w6gb2s37">Thomas Redman</persName> were put in Gloucester prison for reading an epistle from the Meeting for Sufferings held at Philadelphia dated the 20th of the Twelfth Month 1776. There was such reports and noise about pressing men that we seemed to expect to meet with the trial every day and every hour.</p>
<note type="editorial">Hunt returns to the events of January 22, 1777 in an entry following February 4, 1777.</note></div>
<div type="entry" n="1777-01-26"><dateline><date when="1777-01-26">26th of the First Month 1777.</date></dateline><p> We went to our meeting and were told as we were going that the soldiers intended to be there to press men. The meeting was quiet. After meeting broke up we found them at the door and pressed that is two men in the road. One had a gun and bayonet fixed. They stopped some and Ordered and pressed them to meet them the next Fourth Day but let many pass without Interruption.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> It is strange to this how hardened we seemed to get to these trials; great stupidity and lukewarmness yet prevailed</note>
<p>Yet this proved a very close trial to some of our neighboring women on account of their sons and husbands, there being much expectation of them being taken to prison or before some of the greatest Rulers.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1777-01-29"><dateline><date when="1777-01-29">29.</date></dateline><p> Many of our Friends of Chester met the captain who seemed very moderate. They not coming to any result adjourned to meet the next Seventh Day. Accordingly on Seventh Day of the 1 of the Second Month Friends that were pressed meet again, and one of them, <persName key="w6jb6xn6">J. Lippincott</persName>, said he believed if they had not got together quietly in the meeting house it seemed to him they would have marched them off. Some that were obliged to go strove hard for it and used many hard words, however it did not seem to me the trial would be very hard that time though the noise and commotion was very great. The captain was very moderate to our friends. He and some of them went down to Haddonsfield to the governor and so our friends go released. <persName key="w6n05bth">Joseph Roberts</persName> his wagon was pressed and taken from the meeting house this day. See Amos 4 and 10.</p></div>

<note type="authorial" place="right margin"> though wild youth</note>
<p>About that time the press company went about there was several very comical occurrences. To relate in full would seem more jocose than serious. People being in great fear took frights when there was no occasion and so false alarms were raised which flew so fast they could not be stopped till they spread several miles in a neighborhood, and some things a little remarkable happened to some young men that fled to get out of this trouble met with losses and returned home.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> This was a very trying season to many that was forced to leave their families in a very sorrowful manner. I was told of one that quite sweat with fear.</note>

We had a kind of little meeting with them which was to good satisfaction the new sheriff was with us with whose company we were well pleased, he being very courteous to us and our friends in prison and we had to rejoice together in that love which the prison walls cannot debar from.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1777-02-19"><dateline><date when="1777-02-19">19 Second Month.</date></dateline><p> We were at their weekday meeting which was very dull and heavy at first, but ended very lively and satisfactory. Joshua I thought had very acceptable service amongst them and there was something very tendering amongst us. At last we parted with our Friends in near unity and true love, and some of them seemed not willing to part with us so we lodged at <persName key="w6qj854r">Joseph Buzby's</persName> and dine at <persName key="w6r525r2">Aaron Willis's</persName>. We called to see Joseph Hackney concerning manumitting his Negroes, at first or prospect of doing any good was very discouraging, yet things worked together encouragingly after a while, we had a very full opportunity with them first and then had the Negroes called into the room and had a good deal to say to them all which seemed to end well and we parted in a much more unity love and nearness than we met. (He set his Negro free soon after this)</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> Now in 1818 Joseph Hackney's sons reduced to poverty and disgrace though they had a large landed estate when <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName> and I was with them.</note></div>

The powerful language of mortality was almost daily sounded in our ears about this time. Abundance died in our neighborhood. We heard of burials almost every day, yet lukewarmness and indifferency yet prevailed. There was a vast great snow at this time so that it was a very cold severe time and difficult traveling any how for several weeks so that we heard but little of the noise of the wars for several weeks though there was an alarm of another sort viz. mortality.</p>

Abel was very notable he said it was often his lot to go down to Jordan that he might be made sensible of his own weakness and ignorance in divine things. Peace be with you was some of his first words and he did speak very extraordinary on the subject. He said the peace of God is like a white stone which John saw and in it a new name was written which none knew but him that had it and like the goodly pearl that the wise merchantman sought which when he found sold all to purchase it.<note type="editorial">Matthew 13:46</note> So ought we to do sell (or) that is part with all for it, that there is none of this peace for the wicked. That his servants was not to have this peace if they disobeyed the secret reproofs of instruction: which is the way to life. I perceived Abel had much advanced in the ministry I having made some memorandum of his being at our meeting several years (maybe six) ago. The meeting to me was very dark and dull his companion also spoke very notably.</p></div>

<note type="authorial" place="right margin"> Called it the camp disorder</note>

In the forepart of his illness he seemed very desirous to live longer but about this time he was in great distress and brought very low he seemed to give up and said he was willing to die and told his mother not be troubled about him and said maybe it was best for him to suffer and said his must be done and that he was willing either to die or to live. His younger brother stood by when he expressed these words, and he spoke to him and told him he should be a good boy. Maybe thee will be sick again said he one evening. He asked his mother if she thought he would get well again She told him she hoped he would be better of than any of us if he did not get well again he answered thee don't know that and said he thought he should be a better boy as he did he well. He said further if he did get well again he should love to go to meeting and that he always did love to go to meeting. He said one day when he was in great distress he wished he had a had *Michael * Shion<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> M**S was a strict Friend</note>
to go to a school to always when he came to give up and said he was willing to die he said I never could give up to be willing to die till now and now I am willing either to die or to live. Maybe I shall get better and so he did begin to mend from that time or nearly then abouts. He was I believe much favored that evening both inwardly and outwardly for after having been in very distressed restless condition near week after the fever left him pretty much he was raised up in his bed but being weak he throwed his face down on his knees like and there lay doubled up and said he was quite easy. That was the night he spoke to us and from that time I think he began to grow better slowly.</p></div>

He drew his discourse from the words of the prophet where it is mentioned that though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither fruit be in the vine, the flocks should be cut off from the fold and there should be no herd in the stable and the field should yield no meat, yet would he rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of his salvation<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3: 17-18</note> and that the rod that was lifted up over this land would not be withdrawn till the inhabitants were made to bow under it: that he had seen in the vision that the had that it had been with him to threaten with famine with blasting and with mildew.</p></div>

Some of the foremost rank spoke very discouraging* but at length a small number of friends was appointed to attend the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting and they went down to the ferry but could not get over the boats being all sent away to prevent any passing and dreadful work at this time there was pressing of wagons and horses many Friends having their wagon and horses pressed and taken from them to carry off stores etc. Such doing as this made many afraid to travel the great roads and so private roads were sought for and some traveled by night for fear of being pressed.</p>

<p>When we came to Moorestown there was a great uproar. The people expected the Hessians every hour. When the meeting had been gathered a little while there was a great uproar and noise in the street and outcry that they were coming. A man came to the meeting house door and called out a Friend and said they would be here in five minutes time: whereupon some Friends went out and went home but the most part were favored to sit still. There was a constant roaring of cannon all this while every one of which guard the house but at last came one that even shook ** the walls very much and very much surprised the people. Women turned pale and began to cry but sat still and seemed to get over the shock these cannon seemed so hard I thought it was likely they were in the lower end of the town which was the more dreadful when we came out of meeting all seemed still and quiet and we found it was a false alarm there was no Hessians nearer than Haddonfield.</p>

<p>The Committee appointed to reconsider the method of Dealing with those that go out in their Marriage, having mostly met on the occasion with several other members both men and women  and having Duly considered the rules of our Discipline respecting that Transcription and the Sentiments of friends being freely Expressed, it is our sense and judgment, that our Discipline clearly points out, that such offenders should be treated with before they are fully set aside unless they have been precautioned before, and that where the Labor of love Extended to such, has the Desired Effect to convince them of the weight of their Transgression and is manifested by due Circumspection of Life and Conversation, and that meetings are sensible of the sincerity of the offenders, acknowledgments from such may be Excepted. But where there does not appear those torid[?] marks of Contrition, after such Labor as above said, that meetings speedily proceed to Disown them. which nevertheless is submitted to the meeting, signed this 20th of the 4th Month 1778.

This he compared to a worldly spirit and said, O how glad would I have been to have heard Rachel's voice amongst you, this he compared to the true church that was mourning for the slain of the daughters of her people. Leah was tender eyed; this he compared to the winking and too lightly looking over faults in our children, but beautiful Rachel was more beloved by her husband and she mourned [?] because her children are not coming and growing up in the right way.<note type="editorial">Matthew 2:18?</note> This man I did think at the right end of the work he mentioned something of keeping up the morning and evening Sacrifices.

To be particular in this relation would be too extensive a work for me, yet this much I remark that in this dismal storm or shower there was but very few lives lost down this way. Only one that we were certain of and two houses burned down in Evesham. In this dreadful time we were favored for they came not to our house though they were all round amongst our neighbors, except a very few of our neighbors escaped their company.</p>
<p>The 20 they were at Moorestown and we expected they would come every hour and at last there came three, and then we expected to be stripped and plundered as many of our near neighbors were but they were three deserters and behaved very well.</p>

One Friend said he had (or thought he had) distinctly heard the sound of the want of bread as he walked the streets, in the next meeting at Market Street there was some very able ministers appeared. One ancient woman had something by way of a prophecy a little. She said, as near as I remember, there would be turnings and great overturnings yet in the land many houses would be left desolate great and fair without inhabitants<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin">It did prove so. Many famous houses were burnt down by soldiers.</note> I attend the several sittings of this Yearly Meeting meeting till the last about one on Seventh Day in which the general active part of Friends expressed that it was a highly favored meeting. One day the forepart of the week three women came into the men's meeting and sat some time and seemed to be under a very great and exceeding deep concern and at last one stood up and I think delivered As lively a testimony as I ever heard. It seemed to be chiefly against a forward spirit that would be willing to be seen in carry on the affairs of the church could it heed knowledge worldly wisdom and said though the words might seem well their spirits was against the truth.<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin"> This seemed to be for some of the <unclear>form</unclear> oft R<gap reason="illegible"/> and I thought it seemed to appear who they were before the week was out.

The next day but one, there came one woman and so odd an one that there was much talk of her and many went to see her at her chamber which she but seldom left. She came into the men's meeting and appeared in a very solid deep exercise as she stood a considerable time on the steps between the galleries. At last begun to speak very loud and zealous. Expressed the sense she had of the great favors with which Friends were favored at that time and was of the mind if there was a general turning to the Lord in faithfulness that Friends would get to be favored: but if they were not steady in faithfulness what we had seen was but the beginning of a sorrows: though it was a time of great poverty with me as to the inwards state of my mind, yet I believed it would be a time of very great instruction to me and many sentences be as bread cast on the waters.</p></div>

I bid him jump in. He informed me he was a cooper and was soon to making casks at Mount Holly to hold cider and whisky, which led us into a discourse concerning the excessive use of strong drink. He related a case which was very entertaining, which was nearly thus:</p>
<p>He said he lived with a rich man that was very much given to strong drink and very passionate and he had an old Negro that was so bad for drink that he could not manage him and so sold him to one Parson Stirgin. He still continuing very bad for drink and very troublesome, Stirgin sold him to a captain of a vessel who took him to sea where he suffered very hard usage by the drunken sailors. After some time he was brought into Philadelphia again and went to his old master and walked about the yard very sorrowful they asked him what was the matter with him and he told them he wanted his old master to buy him again and take him away from the bad sailors. They told him he would get drunk again and be troublesome. He said no he would never drink no more that cursed stuff. So his old master bought him again and he remained faithful to his promise 17 or 18 years, refusing to eat meat or touch one drop of strong drink and when they asked his reason why he would not eat meat and take a little strong drink he put his hand on his breast and said it was the Spirit told him. So one day his master fell into a rage and threw large stones at him. He said to his master, Ay you no kile me you nok au my brains out. You no kile me. I live for all dat after I Dad. You never make au a good Spirit, you never live after you dad.</p>
<p>One day some rude boys thought they would have some fun with him and so got and put some rum in his can amongst his water unbeknown to him, but he threw it out with abhorrence and came and sat it down and told them to chop it to pieces for it stunk and said he would never use it anymore and so went and threw it in the fire and burnt it up. He also took the stone home with him and showed it to a Methodist minister who used his master house frequently, and told him how his master threw such as that at him which his master threw at him. This seemed to be done to show him how inconsistent it was to what they so highly professed. His master being a cooper by trade, poor women used to come to the shop for chips and when the journeymen and apprentices would drive them away and say they should not have any without they would bring them some rums this old Negro would say, <q>How can you drive au dat poor woman away?</q> and so would go and give them some. When he left off drinking he grew saving and when he died he left between 60 and 70 pounds in his chest.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> When he reformed he became so noted that people used to stop him the the streets to talk with him.</note></div>

<l>Delight in Virtue, Vice be sure to Shun</l>

<p>Also in the same book I found some lines of one Samuel Hunt of Nottingham. Before his departure he dictated the following: To live in the love and fear of God and if thou meet with any disappointment, thou mayst apply thyself to him, the more freely for assistance, it being thy father's daily practice, in what exercise he hath met in this world and be truly honest, both towards God and man; always laboring in thy own mind to contradict anything that may be otherwise. I recommend this practice: privately to go into thy chamber twice a day to wait upon the Lord for council and instruction in all things and it is thy father's desire that thou mayst be loving and dutiful unto thy mother, and loving and kind to thy wife.</p>

Now as to the wars and commotion here away we have enjoyed much quiet a considerable time, But there was an alarm of another kind as much if not more awful to some and that was an uncommon kind of a worm which bred in the grain of the wheat, which eat out and turned to a fly and they were so far multiplied about Salem that their bread was generally very much hurt with it and we heard it was a great deal worse in many places back in Virginia and Pennsylvania and Maryland and to the Southward and by reports in some parts where it was very bad. People that handled the wheat broke out with very bad sores and it was said people that handled such as millers where it very bad died with it so that it seemed as if it was an infectious and carried something of the appearance of a famine and a kind of a pestilence.</p></div>

Here we lodged and had good quarters and very kind entertainment. Next morning at parting we had a pretty deal to say but it was chiefly to two young women that was there towards whom all our minds seemed sympathisingly drawn.</p></div>

This night we lodged at an Indian house but a Dutchman had got live in it. Here we met with haridsh fare to what we had been used to, yet were far from complaining and bore it cheerfully having each one a blanket with us we lay by the fire and did very well.</p></div>

Now we seemed to be released and parted with the Indians seemingly with great respect and rode down to our friend <persName key="w66z02ks">Isaac Borton's</persName> which was about eleven or twelve miles. In some part of this visit at times I was stripped very much and left very poor, yet in the end I found an increase of true peace and stability and fortitude of mind.

I believed there was room for a more extensive care in them particulars but some of our elders seemed as if they could not bear to hear it and it passed it did not end quite pleasant. This night I had a dream which was thus: I thought I was at or near our meeting house with some of our younger Friends that seemed to be coming forward: <persName key="w6165774">John Collins</persName> was one in particular and I thought we were looking in our Bibles and I thought John spoke pretty lively and zealous but could not remember what he said, but my book I thought had a blot in it and I thought I got pretty much displeased and walked a little away from the others but we seemed to get together again and when we parted I thought <persName key="w6165774">John Collins</persName> said: (and it seemed as if it was to rectify a little misunderstanding amongst us) read the seventh of Micah. I being awoke by my wife getting up to go to market and had a mind to see if there was such a chapter for I question if there was so many in that book but found there was and I thought the contents of it remarkable at that times.</p>

	Edith Sharples, <persName key="w66794np">Mark Reeve</persName> and <rs key="w6107trk">his wife</rs> and divers others was there. The meeting for worship was poor, except a little Edith had to say at last which was very lively and seemed to raise the life a little. After meeting of worship was over, people of other profession withdrew and friends kept their seats and had a conference Alluding to the business of the committee, which was to endeavor to bring About a reformation and advise Friends to square their conduct and practices according to our profession and the Pennsylvania friends seemed to pay very close concerning Plainness but one from Greenwich seemed to take off the edge of the testimony a little and the meeting ended not quite so well as it might. This evening I went with these Friends some to <persName key="w6fv9b6q">William Rogers'</persName> and some to Edward Darling's etc.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-03-22"><dateline><date when="1779-03-22">22.</date></dateline><p> According to appointment Friends generally met at Evesham Meeting for worship was but indifferent but in the conference I think truth was over all that it met with opposition and there was something very close and tight amongst the foremost rank. <persName key="w6cz4d1t">Warner Mifflin</persName> bore a very full plain clear and lively testimony against Friends taking Congress money, which some could hardly bear with, yet I believe the meeting was very edifying to many. This evening, Benjamin Haugh and William Lambert and <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName> came home with me, which was a satisfaction to have their company.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1779-04-09"><dateline><date when="1779-04-09">9.</date></dateline><p> I was about home at sundry small matters sowing some flax and at work at a lye tub for <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> etc. Several things remarkable one was this: a young woman being newly married was persuaded by her husband to be inoculated for the small pox and gave way to it and had it very bad in her illness. She much reflecting upon herself for bringing that disorder on her but after some time she told them about her that she fond hopes for forgiveness but said her life would be taken for her transgression and died accordingly. This he had from Isaac Evans a very notable Friend. The other was concerning the use of buckles. Some Friends in Carolina shewed some scruples concerning buckles coming a fashion amongst them but one very notable public Friend rather spoke for them and rather bore against them that shewed some doubts. Some little time afterwards as he, Zacharias Dicks, was sitting in a meeting quite still one of his buckles broke to pieces and flew about the floor and after that he took to wearing strings.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>
[Journal Ninth Month (September) 1779
This memorandum was loose and did not appear to have been ever bound in this section]</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-25"><dateline><date when="1779-09-25">25th of the 9th month 1779.</date></dateline><p> I went down to Philadelphia, the Yearly Meetings Committee and Quarterly Meetings Committee and the Monthly Meetings Committee had appointed to meet at 4 o'clock to consider of the work to which they were appointed concerning the Reformation. Divers Friends gave in their account that they had visited most parts and that they believed there was some stirrings of life in most places but that things were at a very low ebb in many places. <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet</persName> expressed a concern that he had concerning some customs that had prevailed amongst the youth and the neglect of the foremost rank. This was close and smartly handled. Friends seemed to conclude that we had but got to the door of this work all which was very confirming to me. Then Committee adjourned to meet 3rd day evening at 6:o clock.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-26"><dateline><date when="1779-09-26">Fourth day 26</date></dateline><p> We went to the Market Street Meeting in the morning. <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James Thornton</persName>, <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn</persName> and divers others spoke very noteable. At half after 2 Meeting begun at the same place. A Friend from New England spoke with many others. Met again at 6th hour this evening. A woman Friend seemed rather more than common concerned that the foremost rank might keep among their watch. <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James T</persName> and <persName key="w6427ngj">G Dilw's</persName> subject was somewhat on love and unity and being tender of one another in these times in which so much envy and division prevailed in our land. The stranger from N<supplied>ew</supplied> E<supplied>ngland</supplied> words was something concerning keeping our garments clean from the spots of blood. It seemed to be the mind of divers Friends that the Lord would raise up Judges as at the first and Counselors as in the beginning.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-27"><dateline><date when="1779-09-27">27.</date></dateline><p> I went to Market Street Meeting and there was something pretty lively. I remarks <persName key="w6427ngj">G D<supplied>'s</supplied></persName> w<supplied>o</supplied>rds Remember Rock from which you were hewn and hole of the pit from whence you were diged. Began business ths afternoon. A Stranger opened the Meeting very extraordinary his words was the Center shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from Israel until Shiloh come. At the close of the Meeting a New England Friend spoke very extraordinary concerning children of Israel how they were brought out bondage and brought it along Down to our Friends in the beging they had purchased our liberty by their sufferings and something of the deviations in many reports but that in most places where he had been there was something fresh and lovely, but this was the grief and sorrow of the heart and he mentioned it as a caution that the elderly sort stood in the way of the rising generation . This was very confirming in my mind. This to see so large a number of lively Friends and to see the advantages of the Truthful raised in me strong desires that I and my house might be preserved in the land of the living. </p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-28"><dateline><date when="1779-09-28">28 at 8th hour.</date></dateline><p> Met again and minutes of the Meeting for Sufferings was read which gave account of many instances of Friends suffering and their faithfulness therein which had been very great in many places also the epistles from many different quarters of the world came to this our Yearly Meeting notwithstanding the great commotion and confusion that prevailed in the earth which contained much very seasonable advice and council. There was Friends [last two lines indecipherable].</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-28"><dateline><date when="1779-09-28">28.</date></dateline><p> Friends assembled at half past 2 and a very lively setting it was. Friends went into divers appointment of committees for different services and adjourned to next day. This evening the Committee on the Reformation met again at 6 and a very instructing edifying time it was to me worthy of remembering <persName key="w6b38kp0">Thomas Ross</persName> his words in particular; concerning enlarging the house mentioned the passage when the man went to fall a beam and his axe came off and fell in the water. This I never heard so explained before and many more very excellent remarks was made worthy to be remembered and improved upon.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-29"><dateline><date when="1779-09-29">29.</date></dateline><p> Met again at the 10th hour. Several Friends from New England and that way introduced minutes form their several meetings showing their desire to attend this Yearly Meeting with their Friends approbation therewith which was an example of a lively zeal. William Brown mentioned an account of an English Friend that said he had attended their Yearly Meeting 42 years and missed but twice and said that if he had never met with satisfaction til then he had then enough to satisfy for all his trouble a full reward. And <persName key="w6zw3s78">Robert Willis</persName> said he knew some Friends in England come three hundred miles to the Yearly Meeting on foot a half a dozen together. After reading the minutes of last year and appointing several committees in services and divers very lively and suitable remarks being made and <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn</persName> had appeared in prayer the meeting adjourned til the 3 hour this afternoon. At this setting the Yearly Meeting Committee gave in their report of their service concerning the Reformation which was that the thing very low in many places yet there was on the whole some considerable progress and comfortable prospects. The case of schools was included in this.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-09-03"><dateline><date when="1779-09-03">3rd hour.</date></dateline><p> Friends met again the request from several Quarterly Meetings were now read and that from Chester Quarter entered upon concerning our testimony against war. This appeared to be a weighty matter and some of the tightest work I have ever seen. There was a number of Friends that appeared exceeding zealous for to stand clear and for the exaltation of our testimony and a number that was afraid of going too fast and a very long clost conference was held at length the matter was committed to a committee, then adjudged to meet next day: 30 at 2 clock. Met again but there was a meeting for worship this morning. Samuel Wilson John Sanders and <persName key="w6427ngj">George Dillwyn</persName> all spoke very pertinent to the times and very large and lively and this was the most solid and lively meeting as yet this afternoon. Met at on business the case of such who mary too near of kin was before this setting and many very suitable remarks were made much to my satisfaction. This was a fine day with us and there was something very uniting amongst us, edifying strengthening and comforting. Adjourned.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-10-01"><head><supplied>October 1779</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1779-10-01">1st 10 month.</date></dateline><p> At 11. Went to <persName key="w6s1844s">Anthony Benezet's</persName> this evening and there was a number of choice Friends. The love and sweetness that appeared amongst them was very inviting. Anthony gave me some books to distribute. </p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-10-02"><dateline><date when="1779-10-02">2: Assembled again at 11th hour.</date></dateline><p> The case of a Negro's affair was before the Meeting and closely handled the with great consideration. Many very extraordinary sentences was dropped. Adjourned to the 3rd hour this afternoon then accordingly met the case of Reformation to consider what was further was before the Meeting. A lively solid time it was and I am satisfied it was very edifying and strengthening to many. Many very pertinent remarks was made. Adjourned <damage><gap/></damage> day.</p>
<p>Met again 10th hour 2nd 10 month. Again assembled the case concerning attending Meeting was before the Meeting and concerning drowsiness was exceeding deeply spoke to. A case from New England concerning a meetinghouse cellar<note type="editorial">or seller</note> and a case concerning taxes etc. in this setting. I that Light seemed to break forth and clouds began to move this was a setting in which I that there was great instructio to be gathered in some matters in F H B M D. Met again at 3 o'clock. The state of the Society as it came represented in the Queries was before the Meeting and such a day as this I had never yet seen. The many exceeding deep pertinent and wise remarks was I believe wonderful and greatly encouraging to many the trumpet was sounded, the people lifting, and an army rising up to battle which afforded great encouragement to list. </p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1779-10-03"><dateline><date when="1779-10-03">On 1st day the 3rd of the month I went to the Bank meeting house.</date></dateline><p> <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> spoke very lively. And Thomas Woodward and Joseph Brown and a fine lively meeting it was. I went to dine at Thomas Hough's Rem. This time in the afternoon I went to the Hill Meeting. <persName key="w6028wf4">Nicholas Wall</persName> appeared and divers others. In the evening I was at Market Street Meeting. Samuel Wilson spoke very large. A Friend from New England and <persName key="w6wq14dj">Samuel Emlen</persName> all spoke. These were very lively meetings. <persName key="w6wq14dj">Samuel Emlen's</persName> words was remarkable as it fell out he signified that there was some there that were great and high in the World that were near their latter end that Death was nearly approaching toward them very closely.</p></div>
	<div type="entry" n="1779-10-04"><dateline><date when="1779-10-04">On 2nd day the 4th of 10 month the 8th hour Friends again assembled their epistles from the divers Yearly Meetings on our com[indecipherable] to wit: New England Long Island Maryland Virginia North and South Carolina and London were again read and answers to them.</date></dateline><p> To each particular Yearly Meeting were produced and agreed to be sent. Likewise a request from Western Quarter to consider of the consequence of circulating of the Continental money. This was very clost work but I believe the conference and the conclusion was in wisdom's line. Many very excellent hints were dropped which I believe will be useful. Friends were above all things advised to be careful how they got over the tender scruples in their own minds in these respects and to be very careful how censored one another but to dwell in a spirit of charity and sympathy which would unite. After the minutes were read there was a solid pause and the New England Friends took their leave of us in a very sweet and commendable manner dropping short testimonies against pride and superfluity in dress and household furniture and a very particularly to be careful on all hands not to trample on one another's tender scruples. This was closely fixed on the elderly sort and these who seemed to have tender scruples were closely cautioned of too much zeal and to wait n the patience be wisely to suffer and at last be careful that we fall not out by the way. There was a solemn setting ended in a very solid frame and I believe Friends were greatly united and comforted to gather as many did expressed and as by their conduct and deportment appeared then the Meeting adjourned till next year. And although we had been favored with such a fine opportunity every way. About two hours after Meeting broke up there was a very smart firing of guns and a dreadful uproar in the Town and the cry was they are killing one another which proved to be true and a very great uproar there was in the Town and <damage><gap/></damage> said that a mob had laid hands on divers Friends.</p>

<p>A man in their parts of a considerable extensive capacity and so very capable and serviceable amongst Friends, but giving way to strong drink Friends were necessitated to disown him after which he reformed from it entirely and was reinstated amongst his friends again and restored to his former service amongst them. After some time, he loving cider very well thought he might eat it as spoon victuals. So beginning to make use of it by little and little, he gave way to use it to excess again till Friends were under a necessity to testify against him again, after some time he fell into a heavy fit of sickness in which he had a remarkable dream which was thus. He thought there came a pretty little dog to him and fondled on him and he was standing on the head of a pair of stairs that led into a cellar and the little dog took hold of the shirt of his coat and pulled him down one of them steps. He said he could have went up again and have drove away the little dog but still delight in him and let him pull him by the coat. And he pulled him down one of them steps after another till he got him to the last and even then he thought he could have Drove away the dog and went up again but he still delighting in and indulging the dog and went up till he pulled him off the last step to a place where there was no bottom and he died in that sickness.</p>

William Black and Hope French passed meeting and a raw company attended to see the passing. The 10th of the Twelfth Month last, at our Monthly Meeting the time it held two days and a large number of strangers was there and a lively opportunity; it was proposed by B. Hough to alter our custom of having the couples pass in the forepart of the meeting. I having unity with the proposal urged for the alteration and it was then agreed to by the said meeting without anything being said against it, only one Friend spoke for having it referred till another month. I was sensible it was not agreeable to many Friends at that time and so it appeared more fully at this time. At the time the alteration it was a meeting favored I believe with a degree of the covering of truth and the creaturely part bound down, but at this time the greater part was strong for having the couples pass in the forepart of the meeting, and so it was agreed to alter the rule back to that way again. So they proceed and a poor distressed confused time it was. <persName key="w6b38ksb">James Cooper</persName> was there and spoke very largely, but I thought death and disorder reigned and great was the weakness that prevailed amongst us that day, I think more than I had ever seen.</p></div>

This evening <persName key="w61p2c7g">Robert Valentine</persName> and his companion William Cooper came home with us from our Monthly Meeting, whose company was very acceptable and edifying confirming and strengthening in some things.</p></div>

A heavy dull time it was though some instruction to me this Monthly Meeting at Haddonfield and a pretty calm solid time I thought it was in their last meeting, but the first meeting was but indifferent.</p>
<p>This evening our ancient, four-score, Friend <persName key="w6rg6kjz">Thomas Evans</persName> came home with me. When he came into the house he said, I love to be among the living. I don't love to be among the dead. I feel as if I was at home or had got home, and a pleasant time we had, and I thought his company was lively and edifying in divers things and he seemed well pleased with the opportunity we had together.</p></div>

I thought he said when he lived at Egg Harbor a few years ago there was a vast quantity of fish drove a shore on the beach, or some such place, supposed to be drove on shore by fishes of prey called horn fish. He said they lay like a windrow on shore and he thought there was certainly by a thousand cart load at least and that he and others of the inhabitants of the shore went with boats and fetched them away as many as they could get casks and salt to procure them in, and that many of them were bit in two and some of their tails bit off and so on, which gave room for such a superstition and that the water was covered with them in many places. Some called the fish Benhaden.<note type="editorial">Possibly an error for menhaden</note></p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> James Bilange 1787 told me here that he thought they might have walked miles on them fish and on the shore and not touch the sand.</note></div>

I perceived she had something on her mind and when the children were gone out she said to me in great tenderness and brokenness of spirit, I have been greatly favored in this affliction beyond what I have deserve my pain has been great but my mind has been preserved above it all. I have many times thought such afflictions are not sent for nothing.* If I live I hope I shall be better and if it should be so ordered that I should leave this world I hope I shall be happy and go to rest and divers times prayed to the Lord for mercy and that there might nothing be sent upon but what she might be enabled to bear. I wish I could be resigned, come what will come. If I am favored then I value it not and divers times said she remembered what the prospect or thoughts of death had been terrifying to her but it had not been so of late.</p>

<p>The way opened at this time for a testimony against some wrong customs in accomplishing marriages and passing of the young couples and truth I thought was little raised in dominion and gained some ground at this time amongst us.

Which meetings were accordingly held to good satisfaction and I believe to edification strength and instruction. <note type="editorial">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, March 1780: <q><p>The Committee appointed on the request from Chester made Report in Writing: which being several times read was unitedly approved, being as follows.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1780-05-28"><dateline><date when="1780-05-28">28th of the Fifth Month, 1780.</date></dateline><p> There having been a very hard winter and a cold backward spring there was the greatest complaint for want of fodder here a way that I had ever heard of. By accounts a great deal worse in some places, in so much that by accounts some hundreds of cattle and other creatures have perished this spring for want of food and the winter grain very much destroyed with the hardness of the winter, the wheat in particular. Many fields looks as if there would not be more than the seed gathered, the prospect of scarcity of cleanness of teeth and want of bread more and more appeared and the cries of the poor began to be heard in our once plentiful and peaceful land. The winter has been so hard that it has killed many trees of the wood and fruit trees and a greatest part of the poke and I think the summer birds* are scarcer this spring. The pewee has not been heard this spring with us; she has not come to build under the eaves of the house as usual.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> See Jeremiah chapter 4 and 25: all the birds were fled, to Jeremiah the 8 chapter 7 verse</note>
<p>These are melancholy mournful prospects of which the signs of the times in divers particulars have foretold. This several years past, there had been many uncommon things of late years in our land which seemed to threaten desolation, the downfall of the nation or the bringing down or humbling the people, things that bespoke the displeasure of the Almighty.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> See Chronicles 7:14 verse</note>
<p>Some years ago the hedges died generally all over the Jerseys in one summer. The locusts* and caterpillars were very thick a few years past. The rosbugs were so thick in many places some few years ago that they eat up the young apples in the spring and were so thick on the rye in places that it seemed as if they would destroy it.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> *Caterpillars kills the timber in many places: Joel 2:25 verse.</note>
<p>There was a last frost one spring a few years ago that cut off some fields of rye, but it grew up beyond expectation.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> The peach trees died very much</note>
<p>There has been, some seasons since, blasting and mildew amongst the rye and wheat so that it was less than half a crop in many places and great wasting and destruction has been made amongst the wheat and other grain and amongst the hay a few years amongst the soldiery and martial parties. Burning of barns and barrack of wheat in places and stacks of hay and dreadful work in places toting such like thing about to hide them etc.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> The dry summers some years ago. See Amos 4 chapter and 7 verses</note>
<p>And now there is a good deal of white oak timber and other timber, thousands of cords, killed with the hardness of the frost in the winter and many of the shade trees before our doors are killed.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> A great part of the most valuable oak timber killed with the hard winter and a very dry summer. The fire broke out in the barren lands and destroyed a great part of the Cedar Swamp.</note>
<p>These things I thought seemed to have something of a language in them like that of Jonah at Nineveh when he proclaimed yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown.<note type="editorial">Jonah 3:4 </note></p></div>

Many very pertinent sentences was dropped concerning that prevailing weakness and concerning them who neglect the attendance of weekday meeting. Friend was closely advised not to put such on business in meetings of discipline but much pressed to a discharge of private labor with them in love.</p>
<p>Met again at 3rd hour. The meeting proceeded to consider the state of the church as it came represented in the queries, that of the appearance of youth was entered upon and the establishment of schools for their appearance. After a considerable conference thereon and many edifying hints were dropped, Friends concluded with pressing it close home on lesser meetings to keep in view and put in practice the former advices given forth to that meeting on that occasion and seemed to conclude the work was going forward though slowly. It was particularly urged and elderly Friends to labor to forward this good work and be good examples therein.</p>
<p>Then proceeded to next query concerning our testimony against strong drink, the keeping of public houses, and the distilling of grain and spirits otherwise. This was very closely and zealously spoken to and many lively testimonies were delivered against keeping public houses and the immoderate use of strong drink, stilling of it, or any way retailing it.
<pb n="058" facs="334601"/>
Many Friends appeared zealous to step forward to make a rule of Discipline to disown such that would not take Friends advice with respect to tavern keeping, but considering how few years ago many Friend were in the practice of selling much strong drink and that there was an amendment in that respect it was left with strongly advising to a faithful labor against that prevailing evil of the immoderate use of strong drink.
Then proceeded to consider next query concerning oaths or priests wages and war etc. This way considerably spoken to, but left and adjourned to 10th hour next day</p></div>

After a close conference, there being different sentiments amongst Friends concerning paying the taxes now demanded so that it seemed not suitable the case should be fully debated in the meeting, therefore a committee of six Friends out of every quarter with the Committee on the Epistles already appointed was nominated and sent out to consider that case. Friends from the neighboring yearly meetings now present were desired to attend with this committee. Then adjourned to 3rd hour next day.</p>

	<note type="editorial">Evesham Monthly Meeting minutes, November 1780. <q><p>The Clerk produced a Minute from our last Quarterly Meeting together with the report of the Committee, relative to the Method of Monthly Meetings proceeding with such of our Members, as have taken the Tests of Allegiance and: which was several times read being as follows (Viz.)</p>
	<p>We of the Committee appointed by the Quarterly Meeting agreeable to the request of Evesham Monthly Meeting to consider the Rule of the Yearly Meeting, respecting the Tests of Allegiance &amp;c: having met and solidly considered the same, do give it as our sense and Judgment that although the said Minute is not altogether explicit, it may be safe for Monthly Meetings to require written acknowledgments under Hand, from all who deviate in that matter, to be entered on the Minutes of the Monthly Meeting: and also may proceed to disown all who refuse, or neglect, to make such Acknowledgments to the satisfaction of such Meetings by a Testimony to be entered on their Minutes in like manner.</p>
	<p>And we are of the Judgment that while any appear desirous to Avail themselves, of any advantage that may arise from the Certificates given them, on taking such Tests, that they are not brought to a suitable disposition of mind to make an Acknowledgment for such their deviation.</p>
		<p>And that where any from true Conviction in their own minds, of the necessity thereof, are made willing to return such their Certificates, friends might encourage and strengthen such therein.

t was generally thought so. He said he was laughed at when he was younger and once thirty years ago in particular a remarkable instance. He said <persName key="w6rg6kjz">Thomas Evans</persName> stood up to speak at Evesham and there was a divers wicked noted profligate fellows began to laugh and whisper together and <persName key="w6rg6kjz">Thomas</persName> took notice of their behavior and spoke to them in particular and said woe to them that laugh now for they shall weep and that the Lord would laugh at their calamity and mock when their fear cometh and if I remember right that they would some of them soon be removed. However so it fell out that divers of that wicked club were soon after taken away by death and one in particular in a most lamentable noted manner. I knew some of them and have often heard of their club, noted for their wickedness and drinking and swearing in particular and by account some of them being asleep in sin did see their passage verified. Proverbs 6:11: Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep, so shall thy poverty come as one that traveleth and thy want as an armed man.</p></div>

The meeting continued by adjournments till Seventh Day Evening. The most weighty matters that came before this meeting was concerning our testimony against wars, paying taxes etc and against the excess and unnecessary use of strong drink, tavern keeping and the West India trade and the oppression of the poor Blacks. Matters concerning these things was closely lively and powerfully spoke to and truths testimony was raised into dominion over all against these things in great eminence. This meeting, I thought, was not quite so much favored and open as some I have seen, yet I believed it was a time great Instruction, strengthening and edifying to many.</p></div>

One was concerning the testimony of the Mennonists<note type="editorial">Mennonites</note> against superfluity and against slave keeping as follows: A Friend a hatter some years ago took a parcel of women's hats to Lancaster to sell and the young Mennonist women were pleased with them and bought them but their elders were not easy with any new fashions coming amongst them and held a conference amongst the Friends. The next time he came with hats to sell, not to be instrument in introducing new fashion or superfluity amongst them but in particular if he brought any more that way to let them be plain and no* ribbons about them.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="right margin"> *See our own book of discipline against ribbon about men or women's hats.</note>
<p>And that one of the Mennonists had agreed for to buy a Negro and next night before he got him home he dreamed he saw a ladder that reached to heaven and he thought he attempted to go up it and there came a Negro man and thrust him off and he attempted the second and third time and the Negro pushed him off each time. And he awoke and concluded he would go back and having no more to do with the Negro and accordingly went back next morning and threw up his bargain. And the Friend said the Mennonists allow none bought in amongst them, that they disown their members for it, and there is no remedy for them that buy them till they make the Negro's restitution.</p></div>

<p>One day last week I went to French's mill and in conversation two things was remarkable and I had not the least room to scruple the truth of them. We were conversing about the scarcity of hay. Joseph Lewis said there was so much destroyed with the worms in the tide meadows he thought it would be scarce. He said he had bought some grass of Benjamin Morgan and had a pretty prospect of a fine crop of grass and in the space of four or five days it was all destroyed with the worms etc. French Jr. said Joseph Reeve (down the river) told him that the worms came in their tide meadows so thick and so sudden that in the space of 48 hours, less he thought, one hundred men with scythes would not have destroyed the grass faster than these worms did.</p>
<p>The other matter was concerning a great number of small frogs thousands and thousands in the big road.*</p>

<p>But now there is the most piercing extensive drought that has been known this many years so that this fall crop is likely to be much cut off, wells and watercourses fail so that people so far as we can hear from east to west are much straightened for water in their families and for watering their flocks and herds and at the grist mills etc. There is a greater pinch on these account than there has been many years but nothing yet in comparison to what hath been in former years. See Jeremiah 14 chapter, Amos, Chapter 4: 7 verse, Zechariah, Chapter 14 and 17 verse.
See Isaiah 5th : 6 verse, Job 38 Chapter, 28 verse
Job 12: 15th verse: He withholdeth the waters and they dry up.
Isaiah 42:15. I will dry up herbs. I will dry up the pools, which is now the case with us. See the 44 chapter 27 verse of Isaiah, Jeremiah 51 chapter 36 verse, Zechariah 10:12 verse. The deeps of the river shall dry up. The clouds have frequently gathered and many times great tokens of a wet dripping time and yet go off in an uncommon manner with very little rain.

For in that time of deep trials the hypocrites, formalists, and nominal Quakers will not only suffer, but many will perish and come to naught, whilst those who have built upon the sure rock of ages will be preserved by him in the midst of those trials as it were in the hollow of his hands.

<p>Second Month 1768. At a Monthly Meeting held at Flushing some expressions of <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName> towards the last of his testimony when he was about to take his leave of us. He appeared to be zealously concerned for his Friends and brethren that kept men and women in bondage and signified that his mind travailed for their redemption and in the following words expressed his mind, I verily believe the jubilee year is near at hand, and I desire those that have them may not put it of for their children to let them at liberty, for we know not what our children will prove to be. Therefore I earnestly desire that none may put it beyond the appointed time. For if they do, I am firmly of the mind they will be plagued, as sure as ever Egypt was for retaining Israel. This is the substance, if not the very words that dropped from his mouth, remembered by me Hendy Post.</p>

<p>See my account in 1771 31st Third Month. Was at Evesham Meeting with my cousin <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName>. In his testimony he signified he was sensible of a very great and dark cloud that covered the people. He that loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him was part of his subject. He spoke exceeding notably a considerable time. He appeared the second time. Signified the time drew near in which he believed the Truth would spread and shine more glorious, though there might be a time of probation and trial first. Signified he thought the man was grown that would live to see it.</p>
<p>I was at Upper Springfield meeting with my cousin <persName key="w6dn68k9">William Hunt</persName>. In his public testimony, he charged us to note it down and said he had but little hopes of this present generation but it was his belief that the next generation would make a better progress in the truth. He said he believed there was some little lads there that would live to see it. One sat by me, a little boy much tendered at that time.</p></div>

He told us of the many favors we have had, and the warning and that whither we would choose or refuse the Lord would have a people. That he would call others if we refused, and that the day was dawned that would never be totally eclipsed. And that the indignation and wrath of the Almightily would be poured out on this land in a great degree if the people did not return. And that God would be clear and his servants would be clear and our blood would be upon our own heads. And reminded us of the many warnings we have had and of the Negroes in the Southern provinces. I think he intimated that he thought there would be a heavy settlement in them provinces on that account. A neighbor of mine remarked that he mentioned something of an overflowing scourge that would pass over the land* which has been the case since, and now reaches to the utmost corners of our continent in 1782 and has for years past.</p>

<p>I remember soon after we were settled I was building a house or kitchen for Isaac Lippincott and went to our meeting appointed for Thomas Gawthrop from England and he said he had not come the third time into this wilderness country to sew pillows to the arms of the people. No, says he, I am not come to cry peace but a sword. There is a bright polished, quickening sword prepared for this nation. I said once at Philadelphia that the people Smoaked and that there would be an opening of graves, which has all since remarkably come to pass.<note type="editorial">See also Friends Miscellany 1 (1831): 96, where this incident is dated 1766.</note></p></div>

<p>There was a most dreadful spirit of darkness and heaviness beset the assemblies. Many well concerned growing Friend complained much of this and great poverty, trying hard meetings. There must be a hidden cause for it. We came up the road to Piles Grove with the strangers who complained very heavily – <q>I can't live so I must ran home</q>: this was the language. A state of ease And formality too much prevails. The people are rich, fullness of bread and abundance of spiritual idleness prevails that way. But notwithstanding all this, I believe it was a time of great instruction to me and I believe to many more.</p>
<p><persName key="w6jb6xn6">Joshua Lippincott</persName> and I came up to Samuel Lippincott's to lodge.

<p>This Yearly Meeting being informed that there was vessels fitting out from several parts of our continent and some already gone to Africa to bring in more Negroes this meeting appointed a large committee got together. <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> appeared in prayer, very eminently, prayed that the hearts of the rulers might be opened. This committee of fourteen Friends of the foremost rank appointed to deliver the petition or Address to the Congress. The other matters that was the most lively in this meeting was concerning Friends trading in or importing West India produce or the product of the labor of the oppressed slaves particular. Was smartly handled but there seemed not time sufficient to go into a consideration of the state of society neither in this nor the select meeting.<note type="editorial">In the Journal, there is an additional line here: Another subject that was zealously handled was concerning plainness.</note> <persName key="w6jd66gz">G.

Meditations on the earthquake 1763

Heaven often before the fatal bolt is hurled,
Gives timely notice to an erring world,
Some lesser woes are harbingers of great,
O! sinner, fear and dread approaching fate,
Whilst harmless thunder and whilst gentle shocks,
Still at thy door for reformation knocks,
Rouse from thy stupid lethargy of sin,
Turn penitent and own thy God within,
Or be assured that the increased power
Will overtake thee in an evil hour.</p></div>

At this meeting as at the last there was a number for having a committee appointed to have the care of that matter and consider it with women Friends but others opposed it and a poor shattered miserable time it was. I do believe a wrong light chaffy spirit was in dominion and opposed the truth. Or so it seemed to me. And I am satisfied the more weighty part of our members that were for journeying forward out of the wilderness or world's spirit were crushed down. So the case was referred. Many seemed stiff and could get up and speak in this meeting which in some of our most favored solid meetings were not heard to open their mouths. And to speak of the work of the reformation now as in times past won't do. Many can't bear to come under a close search and seem determined to go not further so that it seems as if we should loose sight of this concern for reformation.</p></div>

<p>This crazy ranter came in, began to preach as loud as he could, but made little stops. And a woman Friend rose up and he kept still which is always he way for he loves to hear preaching. The woman had a very lively testimony but not very long. Then he began again, but made little stops and he spoke very well and seems very hopeful.* Then presently <persName key="w6d59f93">Thomas Vickers</persName> spoke a considerable time but I thought the little silent parts of the meeting was the best. To me the meeting was much hurt with the ranting crazy man. I was poorly and got but little satisfaction. I went to Thomas Woodward's to lodge, an ancient, innocent, sweet spirited minister.

There was several very close searching sentences dropped concerning taxpaying and several Friends seemed to think it was time of more danger now than it was in the time of the war. <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> spoke closely concerning Friends letting collectors etc. pay their tax and then settle with them. Another Friend dropped a caution to beware of the dragon's tail and said what had been suffered to try Friends in years past might be like the teeth or the claws of the dragon. This Quarterly Meeting and select meeting have the case of schools very lively before them.
I came from Thomas Woodward's about 18 miles to Caleb Pierce's (to lodge). A substantial elder who had a large family of children. All seemed near and alive in the truth. An exemplary family throughout.</p></div>

Philadelphia: Joseph Cruckshank, 1774.</note> He gave me an account of their dissenting from Friends and for what reason and that he believed the time would come where they would be joined to Friends. The reason as he informed me of that people being separated from Friends was one Joseph Nichols appeared in the ministry amongst Friends and soon became large and very zealous and particularly so against superfluity of all kinds believing unnecessary expense in all its branches, sprang from an evil root and so thought it needful to come out of in every particular. And so being very zealous he went out from amongst Friends, he thinking Friends too cold and indifferent about these things and they thinking him and his followers too zealous. But this Friend J. Register told me that in his visit they told him they thought that as Friends were now more warm about them things and thought it likely that they should come together again. J.R. said he felt great nearness when with them and that many were near the truth and possessed what they professed and had good satisfaction amongst them.</p></div>

<p>Divers Friends of our Monthly Meeting being under some concern respecting the great growth and increase of pride amongst us and believing it right and according to the direction of the Yearly Meeting to have some parts of our discipline read at a suitable time. After some time of deliberation, our Monthly Meeting appointed a committee to draw out some such parts as might be most suitable to the present state of Friends respecting the charge of parents in the appearance of children and plainness and something respecting the love of the world etc.</p>
<p>And on the 26 at Moorestown a meeting was held for the purpose. <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evans</persName> was there and we had a pretty smart lively time but not so open a door of entrance as was desirable though ability seemed to be afforded to labor and place things close home.</p></div>

<p>See page 189, he says, I went to visit a Friend that was much afflicted with lowness of spirit and in a despairing way although he had from his youth been a very sober and orderly man but providence having favored him with considerable substance he imagined he transgressed in having everything too fashionable and too rich and did not serve his maker with his substance as he ought to have done, this was a great load upon him.</p>

Wilmington, [Delaware: James Adams.]</note></p>
<p>Now see Bownas' further account of the earthquake, page 190, in a letter from his Friends, informing him of the earthquake before noted. How that at Newberry, Haverill, Amesbury and places adjacent it continued for fourteen days and was felt a long ways on the banks of Merrimack River. The account was confirmed by many who felt it who declared themselves afraid to remain in their houses during the several shocks which returned every twenty four hours, continuing about the space of three minutes. The inhabitants did much blame themselves for their pride and luxury taking this to be a judgment upon them for these things.</p>
<p>See <persName key="w6kf2phb">Chalkley</persName>, page 585 and 57. See Genesis 18:20: The cry of Sodom is great, those who like Esau sell their birthright forsake their own mercies and may great and bitter cry and not be heard in a day of calamity.

I reminded him of some of his own words amongst us some years past that there was a fine lively stir amongst Friends in New England and that there had been amongst us, but there seemed room to fear we should loose it all if the Hessians did not come again.

And although at this time I had satisfaction in clearing myself yet with respect to most of these matters I think we have lost ground. Except that of the use of spirituous liquors. There seemed to be a lively united testimony held up. I think the meeting was pretty lively and favored, though we are in a languishing condition in my apprehension.

And so a good meeting to many. The meeting for business was in my apprehension an old-fashioned sort of a time, too much formality and contentedness therein in answering our queries. So it was but a low time to me yet there were many pertinent edifying sentences dropped by strangers and others, <persName key="w68m543d">John Simpson</persName> in particular, respecting living within the bounds of our circumstances. Although we could say we did live within the bounds of our circumstances and none like to be losers by us, yet he intimated a thought that were going into a high way of living and bringing up our children, that our country could not support the succeeding generation. So advised to moderation and to make few our wants</p></div>

	<p>I went to select meeting at Philadelphia. The forepart of the meeting was I thought but low though several sentences dropped. One I thought hit the spot which was that if we ever found ourselves approved in the sight of the great Master it must be by looking inward not outward. The last part of the meeting was a favored edifying time and the principle matter that came before the meeting with weight was that of too formal light superficial a way of answering the queries. The two ancient English Friends Storer and Townsend and <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James Thorins</persName> seemed much concerned and affected on that account. <persName key="w6cr7rz4">Thorington</persName> said he was afraid they would become a snare instead of a help to us.

He was wonderful in drawing comparison from the Old Testament and spiritually comparing them to our present state, exhorted us to keep up the morning and evening sacrifice and mentioned what room there was for remarks to be made on us. Why, say they, if you was to go and live with them a twelve month you'd not see anything like religious service performed in their families and that we had need be careful we did not lose both form and substance. For, he said, he could not recommend to keep up the form without the substance, that is, the form of morning and evening prayer etc. John came home with us and lodged.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1785-10-11"><dateline><date when="1785-10-11">11 of the Tenth Month.</date></dateline><p> I lodged with <persName key="w68m543d">John Simpson</persName> at <persName key="w6c82qz0">Joshua Evan</persName> and in conversation he related an account of a house called Bridewell in <supplied>New</supplied> York where they confine straggling vagabond people or disorderly people for fighting, drunkening, whoring or other disorderly conduct. Instead of whipping them they are often sentenced by justices to go to Bridewell so many days or hours according to their faults and there they are kept to work so that their labor nearly supported the expense of this house of correction and they have little dark cells or dungeons to clap them in. The keeper told him that he seldom ever found one stout enough to bear the punishment of one of them dungeons more than twenty-four hours, for their practice is to go to them every twelve hours and make proposals with which if they comply they are let out of their cells or dungeons and so to work according to the keepers orders. He said he asked the keeper how he did to keep such orders and authority. And he said, not let them have any strong drink and it was easy done and not else. And if any brought or sold any rum or the like so that it came to that house they were sentenced to the dungeon. He said the prisoners often came to the keeper pleading their causes for relief and were heard. If they could make a fair story they had redress if not turned away. To there they told him there came and sturdy fellow and walked about the house and the keeper asked him what his business was there. He said he had as good a right to walk about the house as he. Oh so you have, says the keeper, then beckoned to some of his men and clapped him in the dungeon for his sauce and this method seemed to be generally better approved and less expense than whipping at the whipping post as is common at Philadelphia and other places.</p>
<p>He gave us an account of a new sect of people called Shakers or Shaking Quakers separated from the Presbyterians far back up the North River who were very strange in their conduct and religious performance that they in pretense of compliance with that passage of scripture which exhorts to do what our hands find to do, to do with all our might, and so they run into strange and violent actions and strains in performing their worship.* And they say that the world is near to an end. That way it is to come about their society are none to marry and if married not to have any children born amongst them. And if husbands or wives be convinced of their way, that is one and not the other, they part and this makes dreadful work where that happens. And that their number very much increases. He said they would not argue with any, that if any went to talk or reason with them they would say we are the teachers and all others were to hear them and so would stop t<pb n="157" facs="334701"/></p>
<p>heir fingers in their ears if any went to reason with them concerning their way of worship, manners or customs. He said he did not see them nor did not want to go a near them but a public Friend told him so that he believed it as much as if he seen it. And he informed me that the worm** on Long Island which destroys the harvest did very much spread over the country.</p>

<p>I think I remember some years past to have read in the newspapers of the inhabitants of Holland being reduced to famine by too much wet and now talked of a harvest in Ireland they called the rot harvest by reason of the abundance of wet and I remember to have heard some of our ancients mention the harvest here called the wet harvest that after the grain was shocked in the field it was so wet that it grew till the shocks and stacks of wheat were green and there seemed a prospect of the staff of bread being cut off, and now the wet and greatness of the dam is such that a miller J.B. told me his bolting cloth clogged up so that he could not bolt and of the like complain in other places.

I kept no strict regular narrative of the conduct of this Yearly Meeting for want of leisure and private conveniency or in part because of the poverty and discouragement I was under, but I believe upon the whole it was a profitable humbling time to me. The meetings for worship were favored mostly with a very powerful ministry chiefly John Storer, <persName key="w6cr7rz4">James Thorington</persName>, <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName>, <persName key="w6n87x9b">Job Scott</persName> from New England and Tideman Hull and divers others. In some meetings I felt some tenderness but soon shut up again in meetings for business. Ability was given to laborers and they did speak with life and clearness to many matters and with great edification. The most material matters that seemed to attract Friends attention was as well as I remember that of the care of the youth and the custom of their company keeping at unseasonable times of nights, revived by <persName key="w6n87x9b">Job Scott</persName> and smartly handled. And lively cautions to Friends to beware of taking any active part in government either to elect or be elected. And that case from our quarter respecting meeting by a large committee and those of that side that refused to pay maintained their ground and it was concluded to encourage Friends that suffered the spoiling of their goods on that account, to bring forward their sufferings to be recorded in the Meeting of Suffering.

My people have committed two great evils. They have forsaken the fountain of living waters and have hewn to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:12-13</note> He spoke with life and authority and yet many were dull and even sleepy whilst he was delivering the most suitable pertinent doctrine to such a state.</p></div>

<p>Although he spoke with great strength and life yet many were very sleepy and dullness and ease greatly appeared especially amongst professors. It seems as if fruitless speculation and a lethargic stupefaction hath gained the ascendancy in too many. Oh the difficulty of reaching and rousing such a state. One of our Friends, I think it is <persName key="w6kf2phb">Chalkley</persName>, says he was as much surprised with the approaches of such a state. Think of the worlds of the martyrs. Christopher Love in his prophecy points to a time when there should be a powerful preachers but dull hearers.

<p>This summer there have been several times a pinch with drought in the spring about planting time, then come on very wet. An uncommon season for clover. Then, about harvest the fields were much parched. Held dry till after hay getting was chiefly over, then came on wet and is now very wet. Corn very promising only backward, in danger of the frost. We hear it is dry in other places Virginia etc.</p>
<pb n="195" facs="334739"/>
<p>Richard and Thomas Titus and I had some conversation concerning their wheat being destroyed on Long Island. Thomas told me that some years ago whither in the time of the wars, I think it was, there was a great scarcity of wheat and they raised the price to such extortion as to sell it for 6 dollars a bushel.
<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin">He said the magistrates were forced to regulate and set prices on the wheat and other things</note>
And now for this 7 years past a fly they called the Hessian fly has destroyed their wheat so that they have not pretended to raise wheat, though a great wheat country. But Thomas said they could raise a sufficient Supply of other grain. Those flies have been observed to spread over the country about 15 miles a year.</p>
<p>Richard and Thomas inform us that at the time of the wars on their island there was a time of great scarcity and no prospect of a supply from any part. Many poor in a great straight and much pinched and at that time there came a vast quantity of fish (mackerel) so thick on the shore that their women could wade in throw out with their hands just what they wanted so that the island was filled or fully supplied with them. Oysters they found in their bay at that time where oysters were never found before nor are to be found there at this time.
	<note rend="asterisk" type="authorial" place="left margin">They said those fish were very fat so as to need no butter to cook them.</note>
This is really marvelous and miraculous. Some account I have had as I noted down of vast great quantities of fish being drove ashore on the beach at Egg Harbor, but they were dead and these were alive and so thick on the shore that they could not get out of their way as above hinted. The women threw them on shore with their hands as they pleased. And I think I have heard of an instance once at Shrewsbury like that at Egg Harbor on the beach.</p>
<note type="authorial" place="left margin"> The Israelites were fed with quails and manna, Elijah by ravens etc.</note>
<p>About this time 25 of this month I was informed by Isaiah Haines that a neighbor of his, a son of Reece Price, told his he had been up at a place near Jacobs Town lately and a certain man there rented a large farm, that he had planted between sixty and seventy acres of Indian corn and that a kind of insect had eaten round the roots of his corn till it had dwindled so that he gave over plowing it and said he would give the whole field to anybody that would give him thirty bushels of corn. Some other field or fields he said were effected in like manner.</p>
<p>It may be ten or twelve years ago people in our parts went to great expense in building great cider houses, apple mills, and screw presses and sitting great works in divers places building still houses and setting up great stills and great to do there was stilling of cider, but this six or seven years we have had no apples for cider. Scarcely enough for vinegar or house use. The stilling business is all done with. Still houses rotted down and left desolate. Some removed and converted to other use. Cider houses, presses and mills look desolate, rotting down and useless, and orchards, but a cumber to the ground as some have remarked. What little fruit we have had of late years has been little notte<note type="editorial">knotty?</note> and sometime rot on the trees etc. </p></div>

However we came off with reputation and the people seemed pleased requesting another such a meeting. We dined at <persName key="w66z02ks">Isaac Borton's</persName> and had sitting which was satisfactory to me and may be of advantage to others. <persName key="w6nk4g54">Thomas</persName> was favored to speak to the states of divers present and we were united together in the labor.</p>

The meeting to me was but middling though the strangers had good service and especially Rebekah Pincher in last meeting on that of bringing up our families with us to meeting and encouraging them of our household whither they professed with us or not.

The last sitting of the select meeting was really a very fine favored time. Ann Jessup appeared in prayer. Zacharias Dicks spoke, but Mary Husband exceeded all, though the others were favored. Mary's testimony was chiefly to the elders encouraging them to faithfulness and to get out from home: Leave the bleatings of thy flocks etc. O it was most excellent.</p>
<p>A testimony was raised in the Yearly Meeting against many things which are frequently complained of in the queries but most particularly against the importation and retailing rum. <persName key="w6xf1s5t">Jacob Lindley</persName> said he had been informed from good authority that there was ten hundred thousand gallons brought into Philadelphia yearly.
