                <p>The journals of Quaker minister John Hunt are stored at the Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College. With the generous support of H. David and Joyce E. Hunt, Library staff scanned and transcribed the journals, and in 2021, encoded the text in TEI. The 2021 project also included researching individuals mentioned in the text to create and update records about them in the <ref target="https://snaccooperative.org/">Social Networks and Archival Context website</ref>

                <p> John Hunt was a good writer, but like most 18th century authors, his punctuation, spelling, and abbreviations were not standardized or necessarily consistent. The goal of the Hunt project was to produce a text accessible to the modern reader, retaining all the words in the order they appear, but with added punctuation and capitalization to make the document readable. Some spelling of surnames and places has been corrected in order to facilitate searching. Any other additions supplied to aid the reader are surrounded by brackets. Archaic forms and spellings of words are also retained. “How art thou feeling” remains as written, not changed to “How are you feeling.” The word “sic” means that word or words are transcribed as written. Usually this marks an error in the original text. When identified by the editor, biblical references, all from the King James version, have been identified in notes. Where Hunt himself identified them as such this attribution is retained in the main body of the text.</p>
                <p>Hunt consistently used Quaker-style plain dating, avoiding the names of the months and the names of days of the week. “Monday, October 9th,” for instance, is written as “Second Day, Ninth of the Tenth Month.” The headings dividing the texts were added by the editors, using the standard names for the months, again for ease of reading.</p>
                <p>Hunt had a practice of regularly adding to a series of bound journals when he was at home, but usually recorded entries while he was at Yearly Meeting or travelling in the ministry on single sheets of paper. In publishing the entirety of the journal we have added “loose” sections where they fit chronologically.  </p>

<div type="entry" n="1819-02-20"><head><supplied>February 1819</supplied></head><p>About the 20th of the Second Month, 1819, I went to see several ancient widows and called to see a friend or friends who had lately earnestly invited me, and they said they were glad to see me. I said that was much better than if I had conducted [myself] so that they would not want to see me. The answer was a yes. I said I had been visiting and that I could not please myself at it. They said, maybe thee is hard to please. I said I thought I ought to be so; I have long thought it would be well if we were not so easy pleased with our social visits. Soon after, the subject so arrested my mind that I thought it might be of use to make some memorandum of my thoughts. I remember some years ago I mentioned the subject of common conversation in our social visits – of how poor and unprofitable it often was – in our select quarterly meeting, and it introduced a lively conference on the subject and lively, edifying remarks were made.</p>
<p><persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says: [that] in early days, Friends spent much of their time when together in solemn silence, feeling after their own and one another's states of conditions.<note type="editorial"><title>Primitive Christianity Revived</title>, first published 1696.</note> They were then under humbling, trying circumstances, not knowing which minute their cruel persecutions would be upon them and haul them to prison. Were we under the like trials would our conversation not often be more weighty and more Heavenly than it is?</p>
<p>And <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says the time will come when every visit shall be a meeting and every family a church and every head of a family a minister, and he says in a little while and it shall be so.</p>
<p>And William Bailey says, page 518, <q>and take heed of discourses among yourselves which are unnecessary, for the enemy hath a secret to effect among such things to draw your mind from the living sense of the precious seed of God in yours.</q><note type="editorial">William Bayley, <title>A collection of the several writings of that true prophet</title>, 1676.</note> Is not this a necessary caution in this day of ease? And see <title>Power of Religion on the Mind</title>, by <persName key="w66696rh">Lindley Murray</persName>, 11 Edition concerning John Janeway: he was full of love and compassion to the souls of men, and often greatly lamented the barrenness of Christians in their concerns with each other. O, said he, what indifference to spend an hour or two together and to hear scarce
<pb n="002" facs="335134"/>
scarce a word that speaks people's hearts in love with Holiness! Where is our love to God and our fellow creatures all this while? Where is our sense of the preciousness of time? Of the greatness of our accounts? Should we talk thus if we believe we should hear of it again at the day of Judgment? Does not this speak aloud that our hearts are devoid of grace, and that we have little sense of spiritual and eternal concerns?</p>
<p>I have read of a worthy woman in our <title>Memorials<note type="editorial">Memorial of Phebe Trimble, <title>Memorials</title>, Philadelphia 1787</note></title>  of whom they say she had a remarkable gift and disposition of mind when in company to turn the conversation on religious, profitable things. Are not such [people] much wanting amongst us? Like Amelia Nicholas, of whom it was said she would often, when in company, cry out, <q>Be faithful unto God; be faithful unto God,</q> till she was once asked if she had nothing else to say and she answered, <q>If I was to live an hundred years, I could not repeat it too often.</q></p>
<p>I have been in company with my most intimate friends and we have slidin into what is called pleasant, innocent, though unprofitable conversation and we have talked ourselves very poor, lean, dry, and barren and I have been ready to adopt this language: oh, how seldom we do so well as we might do and should do! And have thought of the language of David to his friends: are ye the last to bring in the king?.<note type="editorial">2 Samuel 19:11</note> And it was said to David, blessed are thy helpers.<note type="editorial">1 Chronicles 12:18</note> and to encourage his helpers he offered to give them rich fields and vineyards. But, alas, what are such gifts compared to what the King of Kings, who stands knocking at the door of our hearts, offers to his helpers? Either grace nor glory nor any good thing shall be withheld from them. And [he] hath said, he that heareth my voice and openeth unto me, I will come in and sup with him and he with me<note type="editorial">Revelation 3:20</note> Oh, what room there is for us to improve in our converse together, to our unspeakable advantages!</p>
<p>I have thought sometimes, respecting our common conversation in our social visits, how far might one travel that was truly hungering and thirsting after righteousness.<note type="editorial">Matthew 5:6</note> before he would get a crumb of bread among us. O how we can spend hour after hour talking on subject to no profit, either temporal or spiritual? Is not this loss of precious time, talking and walking after things that do not profit? So we read it was formerly: many walked after things that did not profit<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 2:8</note> and loved to wander<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 14:10</note></p>
<pb n="003" facs="335135"/>
<p>Is not this an evidence that our affections are set on things below and not on things above? Or else would not our conversation be more on Heavenly things than they often are? But where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. I have observed how some can invite us to go out and look at their farms and their improvements, but less can say, <q>come and see my zeal for the Lord .</q>.<note type="editorial">2 Kings 10:16</note> And if anyone is disposed to propose a religious opportunity in the family, they seem struck of dumb and out of their element – like the earthworm out of the earth, out of their element. In earthly concerns [they are] wiser than the children of light<note type="editorial">Luke 16:8</note> and appear to be not much concerned to know any thing about anything else. Woe unto them, said the Divine Master, that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit<note type="editorial">Isaiah 30:1</note> If thy Spirit go not with us, send us not hence. People, when they go a-visiting, mostly snug up a little – put on some clean clothes, not go ragged or dirty. Remember the ancient council was, <q>buy of me white raiment to cover the withall that thy nakedness may not appear</q>.<note type="editorial">Revelation 3:18</note> It is under a covering of a right spirit only that our social visits can be pleasant or profitable. As [Thomas] à Kempis says and I have experienced, when Jesus is present it makes all things pleasant, like a spring season. Whose loving kindness is better than life and in his presence, said the prophet, is fullness of joy and pleasures forever more<note type="editorial">Psalms 16:11</note>; and not in anything else this world can afford, with all its boasted treasures or pleasures. So herein I conclude it is that our social visits can be pleasant and truly profitable and satisfactory.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-02-26"><dateline><date when="1819-02-26">26, Second Month, 1819.</date></dateline><p> A very snowy day. Read the 21 chapter of Job from verse 7th to the 14, concerning them that can content themselves with prosperity in things of this world and their end.</p>
<p>See [James Meikle] <title>Solitude Sweetened</title>, page 123: When the Jews were settled and in a flourishing condition, Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked, yea did worse than the heathen that were round about them. So, after the Christian church enjoyed rest and tranquility, they turned to do worse than the unconverted nations around them. When Israel fell from the worship of the true God into idolatry, Babylon was the scourge that brought the church into captivity. <title>Solitude Sweetened</title>, page 203: as long as I dwell on Mesheck, I may expect wars; as long as I attend on sin and vanity, vexation and trouble will attend me. As I cannot be perfect while out of Heaven, so I cannot be perfect in happiness while absent from God.</p></div>

<div type="entry" n="1819-03-04"><head><supplied>March 1819</supplied></head><dateline><date when="1819-03-04">4th of the Third Month, 1819.</date></dateline><p> At our Monthly Meeting. Life enough, if it was but all of the right sort. But who of us ever did a piece of work, either temporal or spiritual, so well that when we look back but what we may see where it might been mended? Or which of us ever spent one day so well but what it might have been spent better? Or who among us ever seen a meeting so well but that it might have been better? Oh, said Thomas à Kempis, that I could spend one hour after the best manner! But I thought our meeting was an open, favored, strengthening time to me. When I look over it, I can find but very little fault with it. [If our hearts condemn us not then have we confidence towards God, which is an impenetrable shield and an inexhaustible treasure which at all this world cannot give nor take away.</p>
<p>We used to say winter mostly broke up about Burlington Quarterly Meeting, which was near 2 weeks ago, but we have had very smart, freezing, cold, snowy weather ever since.</p>
<p>Snow yet thick on the ground this Fifth of Third Month but now warmer. A few days ago we heard of the death [of] Enoch Hollinshead's son near Moorestown, about twenty years of age, with a short illness they could hardly tell. He had not been brought up to attend meetings of any sort. See Isaac Penington's <title>Works</title>, 2 volume page 625, on water baptism: we know, having been taught by the Lord, that there is no salvation without inward washing, which is also very demonstrable to others. But God forbid that all should be damned that are not baptized with outward water! And, I add, is there evidence, is there confirmation, is there demonstration? Or will any undertake to say all are saved that are baptized with water? But we read of a baptism which shall save them that are baptized with it. Did not Christ say to Peter, <q>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in me</q>?<note type="editorial">John 13:8</note>
<pb n="005" facs="335137"/>
I am inclined to believe there are few, if any, amongst the most zealous advocates for water baptism (about which there is nowadays very great to do) but what must allow there is evidence and demonstration that there have been in days past and in our days thousands and tens of hundreds of thousands who are saved without water baptism and that never practiced it.</p></div>
    <div type="entry" n="1819-03-06"><dateline><date when="1819-03-06">6 of Third Month 1819 – </date></dateline><p>They who so zealously plead for water baptism allow and say it is but an outward sign of an inward and spiritual grace and was it not said to Paul, <q>my grace is sufficient for thee</q><note type="editorial">2 Corinthians 12:9</note>: and is it not sufficient for all, as it was for Paul?</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-03-06"><dateline><date when="1819-03-06">6 of the Third Month</date></dateline><p> at 2 o'clock we went to the burial of Arthur Collins, son of John. In the midst of his days, [he] left a widow and two children with a short illness, which the doctors could hardly tell what to call it. There was a very large concourse of people, [who] I thought behaved very orderly. <persName key="w6md9qck">Hinchman Haines</persName> had a good deal to say and thought very well and I at the grave. But I thought there was much wanting, although the words were pertinent; animation, life, and savor was wanting. Although we are so far refined as not to bury or burn the living widow with the dead husband, as we are informed they do amongst the eastern idolatrous nations, yet there is a great deal of business for the cross of Christ amongst us yet. Very many seem lulled a sleep on the lap of this world, like Sampson on the lap of Delilah, where he lost his strength and his eyesight. The breath of heaven must swell the sail or all the toil is lost. What damage there is and how prone people have ever been to sit down content with a moral righteousness, like the scribes and Pharisees we read of, like Paul before his conversion. Who could say as touching the law he was blameless?<note type="editorial">Philippians 3:6</note></p></div>

My dear daughter, H., encouraged and opened the way by offering to go with me and a precious, owning, open time it was to good satisfaction. Openness, sweetness, and feeling nearness at parting.</p>

Second Day. 8 of the Third Month, 1819. Weather very changeable. Last Seventh day, the day before yesterday, it was so warm it swept away most of the snow and our winter clothes felt heavy and burdensome. First Day pretty cold, and at night came on a considerable snow storm and some rain. Second Day clears up fine and moderate and the snow went as quick almost as it came.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-03-10"><dateline><date when="1819-03-10">10.</date></dateline><p> My daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> and I went to Haddonfield select quarterly meeting. Samuel Adams [from the] State of New York and Chatlet Jones of Salem, State of Ohio, had acceptable service, but I thought it was but a low time at first. And <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> expressed [that] he thought it was a low time and said he did not know how he could get along with anything. But he did get up at last and seemed to make all shake and I thought it was as [Robert] Barclay says of the working of the spirit: it is like putting a little water in a pump and working it brings up the rest. So I thought life did arise into dominion to edification and good satisfaction.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-03-11"><dateline><date when="1819-03-11">11.</date></dateline><p> At our quarterly meeting. A very stormy, snowy day. The strangers, especially Samuel Adams, had lively, pertinent, acceptable service, but at last <persName key="w6gq882n">Richard Jordan</persName> got up and seemed to make all quiver. And in the afternoon it was allowed to be a favored, owning, open time. What a favor continued to have such a ministry and such meetings! The like not known, perhaps, in many nations of the world at this day.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-03-12"><dateline><date when="1819-03-12">12.</date></dateline><p> We went to our meeting appointed by Samuel Adams at hour four [in the] afternoon. A large number of people. He began to speak as soon as they were gathered and preached till sun set with good authority and lively, pertinent matter. But alas, where or what is become of the ancient dew that formerly descended on the mountains of Zion.<note type="editorial">Psalms 133:3</note> when, at the first of Peter's sermons, 3000 were converted to the faith? and as <persName key="w6912v76">George Fox</persName> [‘s Journal] mentions meetings where hundreds were convinced at one time. I fear the remark is too true: they go to their meetings and are pleased with fine preaching but go home and remain just the same. As we read, <q>they come and sit before this as my people and hear thy words but will not do them…each one returns to their covetousness</q><note type="editorial">Ezekiel 33:31-32</note> Powerful preachers but dull hearers, to whom it is as a pleasant song.</p></div>

Clears up – very severe cold, high harsh wind. I thought I should give out and not go to our meeting, but that it was better to wear away than rust away and to go whilst I could, that I heard one say when he went to meeting through most difficulty, he went to best purpose and of one who said on his dying bed [that] it was a comfort to him to think he had scarcely missed a meeting he could well have been at. So I bundled up and got to meeting and was glad I was there, though things seemed very low, as they mostly do forepart. Through mercy it was as open, evidently owning a time as I almost ever had – like a full tide to sweet satisfaction. Oh, the openness, sweetness, feeling nearness when we broke up, so that it appeared to be to general satisfaction. It is not always so; sometimes I think we are so poor we have hardly clothing to hide our nakedness.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-03-15"><dateline><date when="1819-03-15">15.</date></dateline><p> Went to see a new married couple, Joseph Brown and wife. He is my son <persName key="w6vf7pzj">John's</persName> wife's brother. [He] had given way to strong drink too much. It was a task, but I thought of the complaint against the shepherds of Israel, that they had not sought to bring back that which was driven away<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 34:4</note> and of doing as we would be done by (his wife being a deceased neighbor's daughter). [The visit] came off better than I expected; met with a very open reception, had a pretty setting, and parted with good satisfaction.</p></div>

necessary lives little less than the life of angels whilst by a mind content with little, he imitates their want of nothing, [William Cave's] <title>Primitive Christianity</title>, page 31. But I have often thought, when people are not content with what Christ promised – that is, all things needful to them that would seek first the Kingdom of Heaven – but will be scrambling and scuffling early and late, racking brain and back, primarily pursuing things of this world as if it was their chiefest good. I have seen they are as unhappy as if they were created with thousand and thousands of wants more than there raly [really] are – which, if rightly seen, would appear unnecessary wants. And, oh, how many drown themselves in destruction and perdition in the scramble after these unnecessary wants! Where the treasure is, there will the heart be also. And what does it amount to at last? For we brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out of it when we leave it. And although the things and concerns of this world may have assumed such a vast and mighty importance, they come to nothing at last – hardly a name left little enough to call them by. When the things of eternity appear so inconceivably real, then all the concerns and things of this world sink into an equal nothingness. A few things, simple and plain, serve a Christian; we want but little here nor want that little long. Unnecessary wants more than real ones by far.</p></div>

This is and ever will remain the confirmation both of human and angelic felicity. After all the scramble after earthly treasure, it must be confessed that no joys, no pleasures, no riches, no treasures are to be compared to that of being assured of the love and favor of God, whose loving kindness, the prophet said, is better than life. And at his right hand, rivers of pleasure and fullness of joy; but not fullness of joy in all this world can afford.

It is said the wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool, when he gains that of others. As to gaining my own approbation, I hardly know what to say, for in times of poverty and stripping we are ready to call all in question. But as yet feel no condemnation. What others think I must leave, but I am very jealous of myself, seeing how many ways there is for us to be deceived and have cause to believe very many are greatly deceived in themselves – now as formerly, when they believed they were the children of the Lord but were told they were the children of the devil and that his servant they were, whom they obeyed and served.</p>

Then what can riches do for us? He who resigns the world has no temptation to envy, hatred, malice, anger, but is in constant possession of a serene mind. He who follows the pleasures of it – which are in the very nature of it disappointing, is in constant search of care, solicitude, rumors and confusion, XVI.

<p>I have been thinking whether suffocation or starvation, at which has proved the most afflicting or destructive to mankind, and concluded that if famine has slain its thousands, suffocation has slain it tens of thousands – especially as to the inward life, the better life, the life of the inward man. As <persName key="w67h3crq">Joseph White</persName> said, there was more seed lost on the thorny ground, suffocated and choked with the cares of the world, than any other.

As Lady Guion says  and as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, they like them so well they would never leave them if they could help it, and adds, but divers he must go. The story is as true as sad. But is not the middle way best? The middle way to every step reveal. Let me not heights of woe nor pleasure feel. But petition like Agur we read of whose prayer was: remove far from me vanity and lies, give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me, least I be full and deny thee, or least I be poor and steal and take the name of the Lord in vain.<note type="editorial">Proverbs 30:8-9</note> As Walter Rawlie said to his wife, if you can live above want, care for no more – the rest is but vanity. The promise is, all things needful shall be added to them who seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness,<note type="editorial">Luke 12:30-31</note> and that no needful or good thing shall be wished from them. But oh, the scuffle and scramble after more than is needful, wrecking both brain and back! See the voyages they make and the journey they take to lay our treasures on earth.

<p>See Sarah Grubb's letters page 114: divers of the younger sort amongst them have been visited with affliction. The day of the Lord hath come upon all that was lifted up and the projects like the ships of Tarsish, which were intended to go to fetch gold, have been broken early in their setting out, as at Eziongeber, and all their pleasant pictures spoiled. Which have evidently been permitted in mercy, that their affections might be loosened from things transient and perishing and instead thereof things durable and riches and righteousness become their inheritance.</p>
<p>See <title>Evangelical magazine</title>, page 473, The Constitution of the first Church in Jerusalem: the first Church was constituted. Utility and simplicity distinguished its organization. The officers essential to its prosperity were elders who exercised the pastoral function and deacons who superintended its temporal concerns. These were chosen by the suffrage of the people. The apostolic office, though by far the most eminent and adapted to the exercise of the Church, in its infant state. We have the testimony of one, who was never suspected of partiality for the gospel <q>that the primitive Church was united only by the ties of faith and charity; independence and equality formed the basis of its construction.</q> To the morals of its members the most rigorous attention was paid and discipline in all its awful inflexibility was impartially maintained. The disciples of the immaculate Jesus trod in the footsteps of this glorious leader, and emulated each other in zeal for good works. What humility, what forbearance, what brotherly love, what self denial, what kindness towards all men and devotion towards God marked the character of the primitive believers! The doctrine of the first Church, the divine energy of the Holy Ghost in the renewal of the sinners' mind to repentance, the experimental enjoyments of divine truth and its influence upon our lives and tempers were constantly inculcated and the absolute necessity of faith in these doctrines was invariably urged upon all who were admitted into Christian communities. Something more serious, deep, and weighty than barely dipping the body in water. No oppressor, no extortioner among them, but a spirit and disposition quite contrary to that. A great difference between that and a state of ease and bear formality and lukewarmness now prevalent.</p></div>

<p>A lad, Moses Watson's son, six or seven, next neighbor, has a son who has lain very ill two weeks past, but is getting better. These somewhat new cases but seem not much alarming.</p>
<p>To keep right, what humility, what fear, patience, what watchfulness, what resignation it requires. But as [Edward] Young on Resignations says:</p>
<lg><quote type="poem">
<l>What cannot resignation do?</l>
<l>It wonders can perform</l>
<l>That powerful charm thy will be done</l>
<l>Can lay the lowest storm.</l></quote>
<note type="editorial">Edward Young, “Resignation”</note></lg>

<p>Again, see Evangelical Magazine, page 373: as God is a perfect being, he cannot act amiss; as he is a sovereign, he has a right to dispose of the affairs of his creatures as he pleases; as he is infinitely good, he wills in all things the happiness of his people, creatures here, and their eternal bliss hereafter.</p>
<p>That it is the Christian's privilege follows of course; what is his duty is also his privilege. Duty is also his privilege. It is his privilege as it is his happiness, and we are so far only truly happy as we are truly and resigned to the divine will. As to be given up to our own wills is misery and distress, so to know no will but God's is the summit of our happiness. Know, my son, says Thomas à Kempis that nothing hurts thee so much as thy own will. Self [is] the greatest enemy; they that conquers self conquer their greatest enemy.</p></div>

<p>First Day. At our meeting, a poor, low, shut up time to me. One of our ministers took up all the latter part of the meeting, but still if there was any life or animation it was hid from me, although I was not destitute of suitable matter. Lowness. 3rd hour we went to the burial of Dr. Joshua Hollinshead. In the midst of his days, a captive to strong drink, to be feared; shortened his days with it. Taken in fits and lay a few days unsensible. Left a wife and several children. It is wonderful to think and see how full of people our country is got to be. There was a great concourse of people of goodly appearance, as to the outward evident demonstrations of a sufficient care for the body, and as much evidence and tokens of unconcernedness for the soul. I ventured to break silence amongst them and have cause to repent it. This evening, my cousin Henry Warrington and I, being nominated by our Monthly Meeting, had an opportunity whilst a young man who lately brought a certificate from Plainfield. To good satisfaction; something owning and savory. So the day closed in peace, though very feeble and tottering.

As to the state of religion in the present day, in too general [of a] way, people seem to treat it with such a trifling indifferent way and so intoxicated with prosperity that they seem to be settled down at ease and fallen a sleep on the lap of this world, like Sampson on the lap of Delilah, where he lost his strength and his eyesight. And how unfit are they to hear whilst in such a state of intoxication and slumber. I wonder if they are not in a state harder to reach than the people were in Peter's days, when 3,000 were converted to the Christian faith at the preaching of his first sermon, 2,000 at the next. But what people did ever bear prosperity?

It appeared to be a lively time. I had some satisfaction, although at last I was so overcome with faintness and dizziness they were forced to help me out of meeting to a friend's house before the meeting concluded, and it was with difficulty I got home. But after some rest, got better. See the words of Elisha, 2 Kings verses 2 and 14: Where is the Lord God of Elijah? When I think of our meetings and the abundance of preaching we have and the little growth and affects, I am ready to say; what is become of the ancient dew we read of that descended upon the Mountains of Zion<note type="editorial">Psalm 133:3</note> and the celestial showers that our first Friends so frequently mention, which was frequently witnessed in their meetings to the tendering and contriting their hearts, even to tears, so that in some of their meetings there was scarcely a dry eye?</p>
<p>As Richard Davies says (see his Book page 35), we wished to feel the Lord amongst us in all our coming together. When the First Day of the week came we went to a meeting at W. Panes, at the wild copse, where we had a silent meeting, and, though it was silent from words, yet the word of the Lord God was among us; it was as a hammer and a fire; it was sharper than any two-edged sword; it pierced our inward parts. It melted and brought us into tears [so] that there was scarcely a dry eye among us. The Lord's blessed power overshadowed our meeting and I could have said that God alone was master of that assembly. But alas, where are we and how is it with us in these days of peace and plenty?</p>
<p>[marginal note] A pinching time of dry weather. It is like it will cut off thousands of loads of hay. So warm it was very oppressive.

When the First Day of the week came we went to a meeting at W. Panes, at the wild cop [?], where we had a silent meeting, and, though it was silent from words, yet the word of the Lord God was among us; it was as a hammer and a fire; it was sharper than any two-edged sword; it pierced our inward parts. It melted and brought us into tears [so] that there was scarcely a dry eye among us. The Lord's blessed power overshadowed our meeting and I could have said that God alone was master of that assembly. But alas, where are we and how is it with us in these days of peace and plenty?
Our first Friends tell of heart-tendering times they had at their meetings. At one, they say, the floor where they sat was so sprinkled with tears that it looked as if there had been a sprinkling of rain upon it. But alas, how rare a thing it is nowadays to see a tear or tokens of contrition or brokenness of heart. For under the most powerful ministry that we have instead of a tear they are often seen to be drowsy and sit nodding. Powerful preachers and dull hearers. As it was said to the Prophet, they come before thee as the people cometh; they sit before thee as my people; they hear thy words but will not do them; each one returns to his covetousness.<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 33:31</note> As a certain writer observes, they go to meeting and are pleased with their fine preaching return and remain just the same. A broken heart and a contrite spirit, it is said, the Lord will not despise [Psalm 51:17], but he loathes lukewarmness, formality, mockery, and hypocrisy.</p></div>

May the ancient complaint never be applicable to us: they come before thee as the people cometh they hear thy word but will not do them; each one returns again to his covetousness.<note type="editorial">Ezekiel 33:31</note> And again, as one observes, they got to their meeting and are pleased with their fine preaching but go home and remain just the same, without improvement.

<p>We now hear of great alarms in Philadelphia of mad dogs; that they have resolved to kill all found in the streets and that several have died of late in divers places with the bite of mad dogs.

<p>[marginal note] Many weeks very dry weather. Although divers times great signs, but went of with very little. Crops of grass very light, indeed.
<pb n="024" facs="335156"/>
See Ezekiel 14 and 21: when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem: the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence. I know not what these noisome beasts were and whither or not these mad dogs may not be called noisome beasts, with which the City of Philadelphia is at this time so much alarmed (several having lately died with the bite of mad dogs). So they come to a resolve to kill all the dogs found in the streets. In the time of the Revolutionary war, when the English army lay in the City, many were pinched and straitened to get bread and it was said some of the nobility, gentry, or highest class were seen to carry a sack of meal. In the time of the pestilential Yellow Fever, they say several thousands were swept away in a few months and many fled till the streets looked desolate. Many houses great and fair were left desolate without inhabitance [inhabitants]. So we may observe they have had a taste of these 4 sore judgments, although as yet but very light to what former ages and nations have felt of them. Read the Lamentations of Jeremiah.</p>

I have admired how scarce very few birds there are now. When we used to have such great multitudes flocks of various sorts, now they are very few indeed.

There is a language, a voice, in the signs of the times. As it was said, if they will not hearken to the first sign, they will hearken to the voice of the other sign.<note type="editorial">Exodus 4:8</note> The death among the hedges, just after they had got in the way of fencing their farms with hedge fence, which they concluded would endure always and so save the timber; the death amongst the peach trees, our most choice delicious fruit (a worm growed at the root like Jonah's gourd); a death amongst the trees of the woods, the hickory, the most choice for fuel; a death among the white oak timber, the most excellent for building houses or carriages; a death among the black and Spanish oaks, whose bark is the best for tanning leather. Then came a destroying insect among the bees and deprived us of our honey, our chiefest sweet. Now this summer there appears a kind of an uncommon worm on the cherry trees that threatens their destruction. Doth these things seem like blessings for obedience, or like threatenings and judgments for disobedience? Do they not seem like the tokens of divine displeasure?
See Canticles 2:12 verse: the time of the singing of birds is come.<note type="editorial">Song of Solomon 2:12</note> I remember when the singing of birds was charming and very pleasant.

<p>See 2 volume <persName key="w6qw4c8z">Hoyland's</persName> work, page 322. After a relation of the miserable, degraded state of the idolatry of many nations and the notorious principles of some abominable infidels and deists and atheists, opposing the Christian religion and the law's reasonable and holy institution, he says: oh, Israel, happy are we; for the things that are pleasing to God are made known unto us.

<p>See and read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, the dismal, distressed state of the people because of their disobedience.</p>
<p>The prophet said: though the fig tree shall not blossom, neither [shall] fruit be in the vine (scarcely any blossoms on our apple trees this season), the labor of the olive shall fail and the fields should yield no meat, yet will I rejoice in the Lord and joy in the God of my salvation.<note type="editorial">Habakkuk 3:17-8</note> This was a religion worth something more than mere name, talk, or poor, dry form. We have had no rain many weeks; grass pasture much scorched up, even where they had marled and manured their meadows. And where, a few weeks a ago, their creatures were up to their eyes in pasture, it is now dried up scorched brown with the drought. The state of those in these days riding in their jumping chariots is very different from the state of those when an ass's head was sold for 5 pounds or four score shekels of silver and 4 part of a cob of Dover dung for 5.

<p>I have observed at burials how ready and handy many are to do anything wherein the creaturely part can be active, such as carrying the corpse, or covering it up.

But the Summum Bonum, or greatest chiefest and superior happiness, was his sweet sense of the divine favor this is and ever will remain the confirmation both of human and angelic felicity. I believe this sweet sense of Divine favor was intended for the chief happiness of mankind and nothing short of it. Is not this sweet sense of the Divine favor that the righteous in all ages have hungered and thirsted after, and nothing else could ever satisfy or fill them? This was the gift of the Divine Master: my peace I give unto you; this it is that can make a prison as pleasant as a palace, or bread and water as satisfactory as the most delicious dainties. This sweet sense of Divine favor, the prophet David says, is better than life<note type="editorial">Psalm 63:3</note> and in his presence fullness of joy<note type="editorial">Psalm 16:11</note> But it is not so with all this world can afford.

See [John] Everard's works, page 25: Satan is like a thief, and therefore steals away and departs in the night, even while the good man of the house is asleep. Security is the bane of the soul, when men are careless and in the night of ignorance. And again, see Solomon's words: how long will thou sleep, oh sluggard? How long will it be ere thou awake out of sleep, a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep?

Pasture very much dried up, so that the creatures (horses, cattle, and sheep) begin to be very much pinched for pasture. And I never remember such a complaint of a scarcity of hay for next winter, and many forced to begin to fodder. It look[s] as if there will be great scarcity of hay before next spring. Many poor people cannot get any hay for their cow, and are offering to sell them now, but cannot except at a very low price. Many farmers complain of very poor crops of hay, and some are buying hay now at twenty dollars a ton, but I believe it is a rare thing to find any to be sold at any rate. Milk cows gone dry for want of pasture, it is said.</p>

<div type="entry" n="1819-08-26"><dateline><date when="1819-08-26">26 of the Eighth Month, 1819.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our preparative meeting. I thought it was a lively good meeting throughout to my satisfaction, except answering our queries – the waters seemed low and things very dry and dull, yet there were many lively pertinent remarks. The love of this world hath wounded us, and very many are like those who have taken too much opium or anodine [anodyne], as one says, dulled with opiates. But as for the taking care of temporal interest and accomodations for the poor body, bright and lively enough, no cost or pains spared. Many now come to meeting in such painted carriages as their fathers would have been ashamed to ride in, and their testimony against pride and superfluity almost trodden under foot, which our first Friends suffered so greatly for, is almost lost sight of amongst many of this young generation. For as a dear, innocent youth said when I spoke to him about his very high, crowned, narrow brimmed hat, he cryed out, law, I did not know that anybody thought there was any harm in such things as that! And his father said it was very difficult to get any other sort. So people may go on and conform to this world contrary to that express command: be not conformed to this world<note type="editorial">Romans 12:2</note> and yet persuade themselves they are the follower of Christ and very good Christians. But as our ancients used to say, surely will not the Lord visit for these things.</p></div>
<div type="entry" n="1819-08-28"><dateline><date when="1819-08-28">28.</date></dateline><p> Pinching, dry weather. The little rains seems but like dews, soon gone, and there seem like to be but very few potatoes or buckwheat, but do not know. This night, a fine rain again like an eastwardly storm. See Psalms 32: 9th verse: be ye not as the horse or the mule, which hath no understanding. See the worldling and the drunkard – how degraded below the brutal part of the creations, and how many of such degraded beings there are, like Remus, embraced the present world. I have known several who have said they did want a better Heaven than what they had here in their earthly enjoyment. And as <persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName> says, they would never leave them if they could help it and have their way.<note type="editorial"><persName key="w6p55q0b">William Penn</persName>, <title>No Cross, No Crown.</title></note> I think there is good instruction in what an old drunken man said to his neighbor, who asked him to go with him to look at his meadow, which was heavy loaded with the choicest of grass. Walking amongst it, the old drunkard said: well, I should not like to have such meadow as this. The other says: No? Why?
<pb n="035" facs="335167"/>
Why, if I had, I think I should not be willing to die and leave it and I think you won't be willing to leave it. The love of this world operates like opium or annodine [anodyne], stupifies and besots and – as the Scriptures says – drowns people in destruction and perdition.<note type="editorial">1 Timothy 6:9</note> And how many captives and victims there are who are snared in these two traps, drunkenness and worldly mindedness? If drunkenness has slain its thousands, may it not be said that earthly mindedness has slain its ten thousand? Have not many degraded themselves beneath the brutal part of the creation? As I heard a worthy Friend once tell his drunken brother, thou art worse than the brute beasts. So like the heath in the desert know not when good cometh,<note type="editorial">Jeremiah 17:6</note> the ox knows his owner and the ass his master's crib, but my people do not know nor consider,<note type="editorial">Isaiah 1:3</note> like the horse or the mule that hath no understanding.<note type="editorial">Psalm 32:9</note> They are not enamored with that blessing which makes truly rich and adds no sorrow, or with that merchandise which is better than silver and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p></div>

The school appeared in very good order. Divers of our young Friends – several young men and young women – give up their time and attend as teachers.

There has been frequently showers round about us, but not such heavy thunder, I think, as in summers I have known. But it is said in the news there has been much thunder and lightning in some places. A few days ago, Josiah Evan's barn was burnt down with the lightning a few miles eastward of Moorestown, and it is said another further eastward. Likewise, these showers reach but very little ways and seem like dew soon gone, and it continues with us very pinching, opressive, hot, dry weather. The scramblers are much tried; they are hard beset to plow. It is so dry they cannot go on preparing their ground for seed corn. So we read, the plowmen hung their heads and were ashamed. If it should hold so dry a while longer, we should soon see that of ourselves we can do nothing, either in a temporal or spiritual relation.</p></div>

It was an awful scene, to feel the houses shaking under us as sensibly as one could feel the motion of a vessel when it was moving over the water; and the trees, as it were, dancing on the hills. All nature seemed in commotion. This was enough to make the stoutest heart to tremble. But when people get so hardened that mercies nor judgments cannot move them, we may conclude they are in a bad or dangerous way. These earthquakes were sensibly felt here in Jersey and in our neighborhood. Clocks, it said, were stopped in divers places and there was accounts in the news of light shocks of earthquakes were felt in many places from Georgia through Virginia, and a long way through the western territories. <persName key="w69889m6">John Rutty</persName> in his diary mentions an earthquake that shook England, Ireland, France, perhaps Spain and Germany!

<l>How tedious and tasteless the hours,</l>

<l>Sweet prospects, sweet birds, and sweet flowers</l>
<l>Have all lost their sweetness to me.</l>
<l>The midsummer sun shines but dim;</l>
<l>The fields thrive in vain to look gay –</l>
<l>But when I am happy in him,</l>
<l>December as pleasant as May.</l>
<l>His Name yields the richest perfume,</l>
<l>And sweeter than music his voice.</l>
<l>His presence disperses my gloom,</l>
<l>And makes all within me rejoice.</l>

I hardly know what was the matter; I had not that satisfaction I could wish. I fear self, self, self has some secret lurking place and deprives us of that peace which is the sum and substance of a gospel minister's wages year and of all the laborers of every class in the vineyard. John Crook's words on some he quoted: when the mind thinketh nothing and the body acteth nothing and the soul craveth nothing contrary to the will of the great Creator, then there is true peace and solid satisfaction.<note type="editorial">John Crook, 1617-1699, <title>The design of Christianity testified in the books, epistles, and manuscripts of that ancient faithful servant of Christ, John Crook</title>.

<p>This fine rain will open the way for seeding, which many have been waiting for weeks past.

<div type="entry" n="1819-09-30"><dateline><date when="1819-09-30">30th of the Ninth Month, 1819.</date></dateline><p> Fifth Day. At our meeting. Something more open, more owning, more savory and sweet than common – uniting, strengthening, and satisfactory. The rain, for many months past, has come very sparingly, but now very freely. A few days ago, it was so dry we could not sow our seed corn, and now so wet some cannot sow. The fields, meadows, and lanes have been scorched brown with the drought; now the grass has sprung up so that pasture looks more fresh and green than it has for weeks and months past.</p>
<p>It is said to be, both in town and country, a very dull time for business. Very many now out of business and are very much straitened to get bread. Some are offering to work for their victuals, and some with families of children. These are trying circumstances, and it looks likely to be more so. I don't know who can account for these ups and downs and changes of season. I can remember when laborers' wages in harvest time was generally 2 and 6 per day; and now, of latter years, wages has been at times and places as high as a dollar and a eleven penny bit. But so, we read in Scripture, it was formerly, and so it has been down to these days: markets some times excessive high and then again very dull and low.</p>
<p>I have seen an account of such great changes in our first Friends writings. John Burnyeat, a worthy minister, prophesied and told the people they had seen a time of great trial and striving, and of losing their earthly treasures. But a time would soon come wherein they would be as much tried in getting riches. And it came to pass in a wonderful manner in about twelve months, and then they fell to scuffling and scrambling after this world's goods until they were in as much danger of suffocation as they were before of starvation. See the state of poor mankind: never safe nor satisfied, full nor fasting. Agur's prayer was, remove from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches, but feed me with food convenient for me, least I be poor and steal or least I become rich and deny thee and say, who is the Lord?<note type="editorial">Proverbs 30:8-9</note></p>

We called to see five families on the road and invited them to go to meeting. The first asked if there was to be any strangers there. I answered: no without it was me. We are all too much strangers to the commonwealth of Israel. The next were not at home. The next we got the man and his wife along to meeting with us. The next were not at home (I believe they take the First Day to visit their friends or relations). The next were family of people lately come from England, professing to be of the Church of England – but some of them attend Friends meeting. I asked the young man if he would go to meeting. He said no, not without there was some preaching. He said he could not bear to go and sit there and hear nothing said, and I could not promise or say there would. So we left him, but his father and four sisters went with us to meeting. And a door of utterance was opened as much so as I ever seen there; though very dull, low, and poor at first, there was openness, feeling nearness, and sweetness at last.</p>
<p>Then we went to see Joel Evans, an ingenious young man in a deep consumption. Had a pretty sweet opportunity with him, then went to see Eli Evans, my sister's son, who has most grievously given way to strong drink. Has a valuable wife and seven fine children. We had them together; his wife's mother happened to be there, who had lately very pressingly urged me to come and see the family. I thought it was in a good degree an open, owning time to good satisfaction. Returned in peace and got home in good season. There was three families more I wanted to stop and see, but time was too short for it. One was Thomas Homes, many years afflicted with lowness and despondency of mind; another was a miserable captive to drunkenness; the other has been many years a poor abject with the palsy.</p></div>

About 8 or 9 o'clock they went away, and as we went out there appeared a bright light in the north, with streams of vapors or streaming lights like them that appeared in the sky in the north about thirty years ago. As soon as our neighbors were gone I went to bed, but <rs key="w6wx87x7">my wife</rs> and children came and earnestly desired I would get up to see a bright white cloud, about the width of a common road, in the midst of the sky right over us. It reached from east to west as far as we could see. It was quite clear star light. Such a thing to be sure of never seen before, although I have seen near eighty years. It being something so new and strange was somewat awful, and I thought displayed something like almighty power. Some undertook to assign natural causes for them lights in the north about thirty years ago, and said it was the sun shining on the great banks of ice in the north caused them northern streaming lights. But such reasons will not do for me – for if so, why not seen by us before or since until now? And now this bright narrow cloud in the midst of the sky and from east to west, something entirely new to us. Some thought it was the brightness of the light, like as of a great fire caused the white narrow cloud in the sky, some what like the rainbow. But why not ever seen so before now? I must leave as it was something supernatural. I believe many will be ready to say, with the Egyptians of old on a certain occasion said, surely the finger of God is in it.<note type="editorial">Exodus 8:19</note> Perhaps we may have to think of it again.</p></div>

He died in great pain and about two hours illness. He had lived with <persName key="w6d01xtv">Darling Conrow</persName>, and died at Joseph Brown's.

<div type="entry" n="1819-10-17"><dateline><date when="1819-10-17">17th of the Tenth Month, 1819.</date></dateline><p> First Day. I had a meeting at Joseph Brown's, in a neighborhood about two miles south, [with] about twenty families that seldom ever pay any attention to religion of any sort. Having obtained liberty of our Monthly Meeting, [and] I having requested Edwin Atley, a minister of Philadelphia, to bear me company, which he freely did, and had acceptable service. The forepart was very poor, low, and trying. A set of people who seem to know nothing of the necessity of silent waiting, but altogether looking out for words. No preaching, nothing to be done with them. Some were such strangers to the commonwealth of Israel that they were ashamed to be seen and chose to sit in the kitchen. And I believe several families, or heads of them, have been so long out of the way of attending any places of worship that I believe they were ashamed to come. But however we were favored at last with a good degree of the evident ownings of truth, to a good degree of satisfaction.</p></div>

<p>My cousin who I went to see a few months ago, Hezekiah Stokes, my half sister Hope's son, a young merchant at Medford, Upper Evesham, has broke and run away and left a wife and three small children. A most sorrowful circumstance. It makes me think of the words of one of our great European ministers. He said, and so it is: Rent rules over rent, ruin overtakes ruin, and desolation overtakes desolation. So it is. Oh, the trouble, sorrow, misery, affliction, disgrace, and ruin we see people bring on themselves and their friends for want of keeping to that preserving principle, the law written in the heart, the law of the spirit of life, which Paul said had set him free from the law of sin and death.<note type="editorial">Romans 8:2</note> Which, if obeyed, would do for all as it did for Paul.</p>

See a book called<title> The Conquest of Canaan</title>, by John Martin, page 143: All men are happy as they know and approve the true nature, the appointed means, and final end of being so and miserable as these are unknown, neglected, and despised. See again page 144: the command and credentials given to Joshua without a clever call and a good conscience. What can any man do for God? But with these, what has not been attempted, what has not been performed? An attention to God's commands is both our duty and our strength and the only way in which the divine presence can be expected and enjoyed. Joshua was to meditate on the revealed will of God. Day and night he was to observe and do according to all that was written. He was to be what some would call obstinately right. Thus was he to be strong and of good courage. In the exalted character he sustained, and thus only can we be endued with the same courage and strength in ours. And see page 252: Evil persons make evil time, and there have been always a sufficient number of such in the world to try the patience of the upright and to manifest that those who are unholy will always be unthankful, and in proportion as they are so, will always be unhappy. Page 80th: Devotion, if genuine, will always shine in every situation and will at all times teach us benevolence and discretion.

For that which melts others into tenderness and submission fires them with rage and fills them with resentment.

Whatever be the way of that communication – the way he observes is various and often mysterious – but the thing is certain. Let me add that persons are as dependent on the Divine Being as things. Them whom he careth for and whom his eyes are to bless and prosper from one end of the year to the other,<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 11:12</note> they, like the land of Canaan, are more excellent than the rest.

Having got liberty of our Monthly Meeting, I appointed a meeting at New Hopewell, about 1 miles on the way to Egg Harbor, up in the barren pine woods. There was a meeting settled there some years ago, but a number of the fore rank among them having moved to the western country, the meeting was dropt and the house has stood desolate, unoccupied some years. Friends a little time ago, met to sell the house, but some tender people agreed with them to let them have the house for a school house and to hold meetings in it if any Friends should be disposed to visit them. It was a very rainy, stormy day, which was thought to be the cause of the meeting being smaller than it might have been (many of them being poor and no carriages). Yet the house was nearly full. Forepart felt low and poor, but it growd better and I believe ended to general satisfaction. Some were very pressing, kindly inviting us to dine with them. Joseph Evans and wife and John Haines and wife – elders – were with us (that is, my daughter <persName key="w68x44wf">Abigail</persName> and me). We came on our way four miles to long a coming and dined with a new married couple, Samuel. After diner, at parting, we had a little sitting for the better, I believe. Got back to Joseph Evans's about dark, and I very weary, but he wished that we might have an opportunity with his large family of children and servants, which I was not easy to put by although very much exhausted. The family sat down together and we fared better than I expected. All ended to good satisfaction, and we got well home.</p>

And yet it is said that some stood faithful under the deepest sufferings, who afterwards grievously fell away when tried with prosperity. I have heard it said that it is harder to stand wheedle proof than battle proof. But we seem not much alarmed at the wheedling spirit of the world, although we see many are taken in the snare and fall grievously by it. And multitudes of the dear blooming youth in eminent danger now a days, trampling upon the testimony [of] our worthy predecessors, [which they] so grievously and deeply suffered for, in compliance with divine command, which is: Let your moderation appear in all things, for the Lord is at hand,<note type="editorial">Philippians 4:5</note> and again, be ye not conformed to this world<note type="editorial">Romans 12:2</note> etc. Suffering themselves to be persuaded that they can now be very good Quakers without taking up the cross or obeying Christ's commands, as if it was a very silly thing in our first friends to suffer so grievously for these trifling little things, as they call them in these days, and to agree and unite together! To trample on their testimony and call it nothing! But they remain to be the little foxes that crop the tender vine<note type="editorial">Song of Solomon 2:15</note> and buddings of truth in the blooming youth, and indeed are the seeds of desolation and at this time threaten us with desolation as to the life and power of true religion far more than the most frightful cruel laws made and most bitterly executed against our friends in New England did. For they growed and prospered in the truth under their most grievous sufferings, whilst we, under great prosperity and fullness, have too much lost the life and power of truth, which they were so evidently favored with, to the confounding their most cruel enemies and to the stopping the mouths of their greatest scoffers and gainsayers. It was a saying in the days of the martyrs that the blood of the martyrs was the seed of the church Tertullian.
But what does one of our worthy ancient say concerning prosperity? I think this was the language: Not all the persecutors or open apostates that ever rose up against us has ever done us that hurt that prosperity has done. The charge was to Israel former: when thou hast eaten and drunken and art full, then beware – as if it was the time of greatest danger. Then beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God<note type="editorial">Deuteronomy 8:10-11</note> who had done such great things for him.
